<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Identify performance indicators for the service, including the 4 mandatory key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the manual. Establish a benchmark for each metric and make a plan to enable improvements.

Setting performance indicators allows you to continuously improve your service by:

- learning its strengths and weaknesses
- using data to support improvements you make

**(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

Share your experiences with colleagues across the Government of Canada, other levels of government, clients and service providers. Sharing experiences and best practices helps to raise the overall service quality. It helps to reduce duplication of effort and save costs. So share ideas, share intentions, share failures and learn together. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

<section class="dpgn-section-guideline">

## 3.2 Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

Make all source code open and reusable under an appropriate open source software licence, so that other developers can:

- benefit from your work and build on it
- learn from your experiences
- identify parts of your code for reuse which you might not have recognised yourself

This includes working in the open, sharing any and all data and information produced in developing the solution, and making the final solution available as open source software. Publishing your code and data from the beginning of your technology project or programme will encourage:

- clearer documentation, making it easier for your team to maintain the code, track changes to it and for other people to use it
- cleaner and well-structured code that is easier to maintain
- processes that will allow you to continuously publish code as it is written
- clarity around data that needs to remain protected and how that's achieved
- suggestions about how the code can be improved or where security can be improved
- others to contribute ideas as the project is in progress

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

- Work in the open and make data and source code open and reusable
- Host source code publicly in an open internet source code repository
- Use an Open Source Initiative approved licence
- Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
- Keep track of changes to it using version control
