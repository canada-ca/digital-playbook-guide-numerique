**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Evaluate what tools and systems will be used to build, host, operate and measure the service, and how to procure them.

Evaluating the tools and systems you use to build your service helps you to:

- check any risks or constraints associated with them

- avoid contracts that lock you in and stop you improving your service

- build a sustainable system which you can easily manage after your service goes live

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** To improve our chances of success when contracting out development work, we need to work with experienced budgeting and contracting officers. In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources.

[The TechFAR Handbook](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/handbook/) provides a detailed explanation of the flexibilities in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that can help agencies implement this play.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Employ the most recent IM-IT management practices, process and tools **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- OneGC product design criteria

- [Assign one leader and hold that person accountable -- Digital Services Playbook (US)](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play6)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**OneGC product design criteria:** Each initiative (i.e., OneGC sub project) must have one business owner who serves as the project sponsor and is accountable for the business outcomes of the service. The business owner is responsible for communicating the vision, making decisions in a timely fashion, managing stakeholder/vendor relationships and monitoring project health. The business owner sets the strategy for the service, defines the features of the service and is responsible for the service on an ongoing basis, until it is decommissioned.

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** There must be a single product owner who has the authority and responsibility to assign tasks and work elements; make business, product, and technical decisions; and be accountable for the success or failure of the overall service. This product owner is ultimately responsible for how well the service meets needs of its users, which is how a service should be evaluated. The product owner is responsible for ensuring that features are built and managing the feature and bug backlogs.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- A product owner has been identified **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- [Establish the right team (Digital Service Standard (Ontario))](https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-service-standard#section-3)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** We need talented people working in government who have experience creating modern digital services. This includes bringing in seasoned product managers, engineers, and designers. When outside help is needed, our teams should work with contracting officers who understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so our teams can be paired with contractors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services. The makeup and experience requirements of the team will vary depending on the scope of the project.

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service owner with decision-making responsibility.

A multidisciplinary team helps you to:

- build your service

- keep improving it based on user needs

- make decisions quickly

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and continuously improve the digital service, led by a skilled product manager who is empowered to make decisions.

Product managers set the strategy for and define features of a service. They are responsible for the service on an ongoing basis, until it is decommissioned. It's not the same role as a project manager.

A product is anything created for a defined group of users. In this standard, product refers to any online information or transactional service used by the people of Ontario.

### Why it matters

It's important to have a strong multidisciplinary team in place, led by one person who is accountable and has the authority to make decisions based on the outcomes of research, testing and prototypes footnote 1
\[1\] .

The team's skills and focus need to evolve as the service is designed and developed. The team also needs to adapt its structure based on the needs of the service and the phase of work.

To be successful, build a team with:

- a broad mix of skills and roles from the start

- quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves

- the resources and ability to deliver the product
