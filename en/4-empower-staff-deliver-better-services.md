## 4.2 Make sure that staff have access to the tools and technologies they need to be innovative

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Evaluate what tools and systems will be used to build, host, operate and measure the service, and how to procure them.

Evaluating the tools and systems you use to build your service helps you to:

- check any risks or constraints associated with them

- avoid contracts that lock you in and stop you improving your service

- build a sustainable system which you can easily manage after your service goes live

**(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

The technology you choose to build your service must help you respond quickly and regularly to the needs and expectations of users. This criterion ensures you:

- consider all the risks and constraints associated with the technology you choose
- avoid contracts that lock you into particular solutions and limit your ability to make decisions to improve the service
- build a sustainable system that can be easily managed once live
- identify the required infrastructure to successfully and continuously deliver the digital service
- have a procurement approach that will not restrict, inhibit or limit ongoing and future service delivery
- consider existing tools and systems and avoid unnecessary fragmentation and/or costs
- consider appropriate tools and systems already in use in government
- embed measurement tools at the start of development.

## 4.3 Ensure that the right systems and processes are in place so the team can create

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

To improve our chances of success when contracting out development work, we need to work with experienced budgeting and contracting officers. In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources. **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

It is essential that business processes be reviewed to identify opportunities to improve service delivery. A website is not a service; it is just one channel for accessing or delivering a service. Designing new or redesigning existing digital services should also facilitate service delivery best practices (e.g., open data and joined-up services). **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Employ the most recent IM-IT management practices, process and tools

- Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like "pay-for-what-you-use" services **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Uncover user needs and confirm with clients their understanding of the desired result. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Look for opportunities to integrate with other relevant or similar services (i.e. joined-up services) to simplify the client experience **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Look for opportunities to use business intelligence and analytics (BI/BA) to improve the client experience. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Identify policy constraints. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Identify opportunities for improving processes and reducing complexity. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Improve the service first and consider if a policy change or update might be needed. Second, build the digital platform/website. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

## 4.4 Empower teams to make decisions throughout the design, build, and operation of the service and allow them to learn from their mistakes

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Have you ever been to a restaurant and had your food come to the table either cold or the wrong meal delivered and then had the waitress or waiter bend over backwards to correct the situation (even if it wasn’t their fault)?  Many companies are spending more time training managers on how to “empower” their employees.  But what does empowerment really mean?
According to Kinicki & Kreitner, empowerment is about “sharing degrees of power with lower-level employees to better serve the customer” (2008, p. 333).  To me, empowerment is about giving employees the permission to give customers priority and to use their creative talents to find solutions when issues arise, without having to run to management and ask for permission to do something.  Southwest Airlines is a good example of a company that highly empowers their employees and gives them great latitude to keep customers happy.

Empowering employees isn’t easy though, because it requires that a company and their management be committed to continuous employee development.  It means fostering an environment of trust and helping employees learn from successes and analyze failures.

Working to create an environment that empowers employees has been shown to not only increase customer satisfaction levels, but also improve employee morale.  It takes training, practice, and the ability to accept mistakes as a part of the learning process – but it is well worth the effort in the long run! **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed, Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Ensure a strong governance approach is in place

- Focus on innovation and sustainability

- Share information:  Sharing information with employees is important because it not only helps to build trust; it gives employees important information that will allow them to make the best possible decisions in critical situations. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed, Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**

- Create clear goals and objectives:  Be clear with your vision, goals/objectives, and roles.  This will help create the framework necessary to guide employees to make empowered decisions to keep customers happy. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed, Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**

- Teach that it’s o.k. to make mistakes:  If you empower employees to make decisions that will help keep customers happy, then you have to be willing to allow them to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes.  Berating an employee who tried something new will only serve to keep others from trying new things. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed, Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**

- Create an environment that celebrates both successes and failures:  Don’t just celebrate the successes, celebrate the employees who took a risk but maybe didn’t obtain the results intended but learned valuable lessons themselves and for the company. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed, Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**

- Support a learning environment:  This is an ongoing process whereby teams look at various situations and discuss them together to determine how they might handle things differently in the future to achieve a different result.  This is really what our lives are all about...learning new things as we age, by analyzing the things we’ve done in the past. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed, Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**

- Let teams become the hierarchy:  This occurs by slowly and carefully transferring responsibilities from managers to teams.  This can be a very scary and difficult process that takes time, training and a lot of persistence (Kinicki & Kreitner, 2008, p. 335).  It’s been my personal experience that this requires a lot of support time to the teams as they move from depending on a manager to make decisions to being autonomous. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed, Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**

### Implementation guides

**[TODO: Add/revise implementation guide items]**

## 4.5 Make one person accountable for the service

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Each service must have one person who has the authority and is responsibile for makingt business, product and technical decisions. This person is responsible for communicating the vision, making decisions in a timely fashion, managing stakeholder/vendor relationships, monitoring project health and is accountable for the success or failure of the service. This person also sets the strategy for the service, defines the features of the service, and is responsible for the service on an ongoing basis, until it is decommissioned.

### Checklist
