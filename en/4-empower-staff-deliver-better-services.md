**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Evaluate what tools and systems will be used to build, host, operate and measure the service, and how to procure them.

Evaluating the tools and systems you use to build your service helps you to:

- check any risks or constraints associated with them

- avoid contracts that lock you in and stop you improving your service

- build a sustainable system which you can easily manage after your service goes live

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

To improve our chances of success when contracting out development work, we need to work with experienced budgeting and contracting officers. In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources. **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

It is essential that business processes be reviewed to identify opportunities to improve service delivery. A website is not a service; it is just one channel for accessing or delivering a service. Designing new or redesigning existing digital services should also facilitate service delivery best practices (e.g., open data and joined-up services). **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Employ the most recent IM-IT management practices, process and tools

- Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like "pay-for-what-you-use" services **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Uncover user needs and confirm with clients their understanding of the desired result. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Look for opportunities to integrate with other relevant or similar services (i.e. joined-up services) to simplify the client experience **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Look for opportunities to use business intelligence and analytics (BI/BA) to improve the client experience. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Identify policy constraints. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Identify opportunities for improving processes and reducing complexity. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Improve the service first and consider if a policy change or update might be needed. Second, build the digital platform/website. **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

## 4.5 Make one person accountable for the service

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Each service must have one person who has the authority and is responsibile for makingt business, product and technical decisions. This person is responsible for communicating the vision, making decisions in a timely fashion, managing stakeholder/vendor relationships, monitoring project health and is accountable for the success or failure of the service. This person also sets the strategy for the service, defines the features of the service, and is responsible for the service on an ongoing basis, until it is decommissioned.

## 4.6 Build and maintain an experienced multidisciplinary team

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and continuously improve the digital service, led by a skilled product manager who is empowered to make decisions.

The team's skills and focus need to evolve as the service is designed and developed. The team also needs to adapt its structure based on the needs of the service and the phase of work.

To be successful, build a team with:

- a broad mix of skills and roles from the start

- quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves

- the resources and ability to deliver the product
