**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Identify performance indicators for the service, including the 4 mandatory key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the manual. Establish a benchmark for each metric and make a plan to enable improvements.

Setting performance indicators allows you to continuously improve your service by:

- learning its strengths and weaknesses

- using data to support improvements you make

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED):** Share your experiences with colleagues across the Government of Canada, other levels of government, clients and service providers. Sharing experiences and best practices helps to raise the overall service quality. It helps to reduce duplication of effort and save costs. So share ideas, share intentions, share failures and learn together.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Document and show your work. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- If you are redesigning a service document the changes and show how these changes will enhance the client experience when using the service. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Embrace sharing platforms (e.g., GCconnex, GCpedia, Twitter, etc.) to get inspiration and feedback on your ideas. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Before you start your own project, do an environmental scan to see how other programs and services are embracing digital service delivery. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Identify lessons learned throughout the project and not just at the end. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Make it easier to share data across ISED by collecting service and client information in a consistent manner and following best practices (e.g., the business number as a common identifier and practices related to Identity Management (IDM)). **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

### Decision Making Questions: **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
#### Sharing
- How can the team share what was learned during this project?
- Can the lessons-learned from this experience contribute to better service delivery for other ISED services or services offered by other departments or governments?
- Is there a valid reason not to share? If you cannot share everything, what can you share without breaching privacy, security and information management rules?
- Have you researched other services for business to identify other approaches to digital services and service delivery?
- Is there already a GCconnex group or GCpedia group exploring a similar service challenge or innovative approach to service delivery?
- Have you reached out to other digital government teams or researched case studies that document the journey of other services?

## 5.5 Open by default

**Related (temporary for mapping purposes; remove later):**

- Open by default (OneGC product design criteria)

- Open By Default, Proprietary by Necessity (Current GC EARB Principles)

- [13. Default to open (Digital Services Playbook (US))](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**OneGC product design criteria:** All solutions should be developed in the open, unless doing so would violate legislation or policy. This includes working in the open, sharing any and all data and information produced in developing the solution, and making the final solution available as open source.

Solutions should be designed with open source technologies over proprietary ones. Proprietary technologies should only be used when open sources technologies cannot meet the requirements of the solution being developed or proprietary technologies are significantly better than available open source technologies.

All solutions must use open standards to ensure interoperability across the OneGC ecosystem and continued access to data and information. Solutions should use the open standards preferred by the interoperability platform. Where no preferred open standard meets the requirements of the solution, the addition of a new open standard must be agreed upon by the business owner of the interoperability platform.

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** When we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly, we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the public's access to government services and information, allow the public to contribute easily, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Build in an open and interoperable way - Give equal consideration for open source. Use open standards. Build in an interoperable and reusable way. **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- When appropriate, create an API for third parties and internal users to interact with the service directly **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

### Key Questions **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- How are you collecting user feedback for bugs and issues?

- If there is an API, what capabilities does it provide? Who uses it?
    How is it documented?

- If the codebase has not been released under an open source license, explain why.

- What components are made available to the public as open source?

- What datasets are made available to the public?

- [8. Make all new source code open (Digital Service Standard (UK))](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/make-all-new-source-code-open)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or provide a convincing explanation as to why this can't be done for specific subsets of the source code).

Making your source code open means:

- other services can reuse the software you've created

- other services don't end up doing work you've already done and you reduce costs in government as a whole

- you avoid starting technology contracts that you can't end easily
