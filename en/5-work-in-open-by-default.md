## 5.3 Measure and monitor the effectiveness, value, and consequences of your service and report publicly

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Identify performance indicators for the service, including the 4 mandatory key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the manual. Establish a benchmark for each metric and make a plan to enable improvements.

Setting performance indicators allows you to continuously improve your service by:

- learning its strengths and weaknesses

- using data to support improvements you make

**(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

## 5.4 Be transparent about how you work and justify the decisions you make

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Share your experiences with colleagues across the Government of Canada, other levels of government, clients and service providers. Sharing experiences and best practices helps to raise the overall service quality. It helps to reduce duplication of effort and save costs. So share ideas, share intentions, share failures and learn together. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Procuring goods and services in the open is an important part of an open environment **(Open Markets - Open First Whitepaper (GC))**

- When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Document and show your work. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- If you are redesigning a service document the changes and show how these changes will enhance the client experience when using the service. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Embrace sharing platforms (e.g., GCconnex, GCpedia, Twitter, etc.) to get inspiration and feedback on your ideas. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Before you start your own project, do an environmental scan to see how other programs and services are embracing digital service delivery. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Identify lessons learned throughout the project and not just at the end. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Make it easier to share data across ISED by collecting service and client information in a consistent manner and following best practices (e.g., the business number as a common identifier and practices related to Identity Management (IDM)). **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

## 5.5 Work in the open and make source code open and reusable

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

All solutions should be developed in the open, unless doing so would violate legislation or policy. This includes working in the open, sharing any and all data and information produced in developing the solution, and making the final solution available as open source.

Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or provide a convincing explanation as to why this can't be done for specific subsets of the source code).

Making your source code open means:

- other services can reuse the software you've created

- other services don't end up doing work you've already done and you reduce costs in government as a whole

- you avoid starting technology contracts that you can't end easily

**(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

Make all new source code open by default.

It’s important to share your source code so others with a similar need can reuse it.

Open source helps to:

- reduce costs for your project and others’
- avoid lock-in
- stop duplication
- increase transparency
- add benefits, from improvements by other developers.

**(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- When appropriate, create an API for third parties and internal users to interact with the service directly **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**
