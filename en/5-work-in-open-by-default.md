### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Work in the open - Share and collaborate in the open, plan to make data open from the start.
- Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces) **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

## 5.3 Measure and monitor the effectiveness, value, and consequences of your service and report publicly

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Identify performance indicators for the service, including the 4 mandatory key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the manual. Establish a benchmark for each metric and make a plan to enable improvements.

Setting performance indicators allows you to continuously improve your service by:

- learning its strengths and weaknesses
- using data to support improvements you make

## 5.4 Be transparent about how you work and justify the decisions you make

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Share your experiences with colleagues across the Government of Canada, other levels of government, clients and service providers. Sharing experiences and best practices helps to raise the overall service quality. It helps to reduce duplication of effort and save costs. So share ideas, share intentions, share failures and learn together. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- If you are redesigning a service document the changes and show how these changes will enhance the client experience when using the service. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Embrace sharing platforms (e.g., GCconnex, GCpedia, Twitter, etc.) to get inspiration and feedback on your ideas. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Before you start your own project, do an environmental scan to see how other programs and services are embracing digital service delivery. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Identify lessons learned throughout the project and not just at the end. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Make it easier to share data across ISED by collecting service and client information in a consistent manner and following best practices (e.g., the business number as a common identifier and practices related to Identity Management (IDM)). **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

## 5.5 Work in the open and make source code open and reusable

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Make all source code open and reusable under an appropriate open source software licence, so that other developers can:

- benefit from your work and build on it
- learn from your experiences
- identify parts of your code for reuse which you might not have recognised yourself

This includes working in the open, sharing any and all data and information produced in developing the solution, and making the final solution available as open source software. Publishing your code and data from the beginning of your technology project or programme will encourage:

- clearer documentation, making it easier for your team to maintain the code, track changes to it and for other people to use it
- cleaner and well-structured code that is easier to maintain
- processes that will allow you to continuously publish code as it is written
- clarity around data that needs to remain protected and how that's achieved
- suggestions about how the code can be improved or where security can be improved
- others to contribute ideas as the project is in progress

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Host source code publicly in an open internet source code repository
- Use an Open Source Initiative approved licence
- Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
- Keep track of changes to it using version control
- {: .dpgn-digital-architectural} Build and develop open **({{ site.DigitalArchitectural.en }})**
  - Actively use and contribute to open source tools and solutions
  - Develop in the open by sharing and reusing all types of code and platform configuration
