## 5.1 Make all non-sensitive data, information and new source code open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Work in the open and make source code open and reusable (formerly guideline 5.5):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

Make all source code open and reusable under an appropriate open source software licence, so that other developers can:

- benefit from your work and build on it
- learn from your experiences
- identify parts of your code for reuse which you might not have recognised yourself

This includes working in the open, sharing any and all data and information produced in developing the solution, and making the final solution available as open source software. Publishing your code and data from the beginning of your technology project or programme will encourage:

- clearer documentation, making it easier for your team to maintain the code, track changes to it and for other people to use it
- cleaner and well-structured code that is easier to maintain
- processes that will allow you to continuously publish code as it is written
- clarity around data that needs to remain protected and how that's achieved
- suggestions about how the code can be improved or where security can be improved
- others to contribute ideas as the project is in progress

- Document and show your work. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- If you are redesigning a service document the changes and show how these changes will enhance the client experience when using the service. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Embrace sharing platforms (e.g., GCconnex, GCpedia, Twitter, etc.) to get inspiration and feedback on your ideas. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Before you start your own project, do an environmental scan to see how other programs and services are embracing digital service delivery. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Identify lessons learned throughout the project and not just at the end. **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
- Make it easier to share data across ISED by collecting service and client information in a consistent manner and following best practices (e.g., the business number as a common identifier and practices related to Identity Management (IDM)). **(Plan - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
