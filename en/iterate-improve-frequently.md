**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Build your service using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the manual.

Using agile methods helps you to build services that:

- meet the needs of your users

- are easy and convenient for people to use

- you can change easily, eg if government policy or technology policy changes

- you can keep improving, eg based on user feedback

- cost less and are more accountable

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Design and build the service using an agile and user-centred approach. Agile is an approach to building services that breaks the work into smaller chunks known as iterations. Build one feature of the service at a time until the entire service is complete.

It is a much lower risk approach than traditional build-it-all-at-once approach known as waterfall because frequent iterations expose any flaws in the original plan much faster (e.g. not getting approvals, not enough resources, not the right people on the team, etc.)

User-centred methods such as user research and usability testing put the focus on making services that are easy-to-use. Traditional government services focus on meeting business needs and aligning with policy goals. A user-centred approach ensures business needs are also balanced against user needs. This helps to increase digital service uptake.

#### Why it matters

Agile methods build services that:

- can be prototyped quickly (and shown to users for regular feedback)

- meet the needs of users

- can change easily if, for example, government policy or technology changes

- can keep improving based on user feedback

- can be built quickly with a minimum set of features, and enhanced with more features after the service goes live

**Digital Service Playbook (US):** We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users' hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.

- document how the design of the service has changed over time because of what you found in user research **(Digital Service Standard (UK)) /** show how the design of the service has changed over time because of user research findings **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- document the design options you're considering for your assisted digital support **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- document any problems that you found in research which you'll have to solve to design the service, and how you plan to solve them **(Digital Service Standard (UK)) /** identify any problems found in research and solutions to improve the service **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- have a quality assurance testing and rollback plan that supports frequent iterations to the service **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- use a phased approach to test changes to part of service, when feature-based changes are not feasible **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**



- Ship a functioning "minimum viable product" (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a "beta" or "test" period if needed **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Release features and improvements multiple times each month **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the "feature backlog" and "bug backlog" **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Use a source code version control system **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- Use code reviews to ensure quality **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

#### Key Questions **(Digital Service Playbook (US))**

- How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it hasn't shipped yet, when will it?

- How long does it take for a production deployment?

- How many days or weeks are in each iteration/sprint?

- Which version control system is being used?

- How are bugs tracked and tickets issued? What tool is used?

- How is the feature backlog managed? What tool is used?

- How often do you review and reprioritize the feature and bug backlog?

- How do you collect user feedback during development? How is that feedback used to improve the service?

- At each stage of usability testing, which gaps were identified in addressing user needs?
