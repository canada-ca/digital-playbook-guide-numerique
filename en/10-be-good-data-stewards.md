## 10.2 Make relevant government information and data easily accessible to help support decision making

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

At every stage of a project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with it in real-time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to find issues and identify which bug fixes and improvements should be prioritized. Along with monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly. **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

## 10.3 Ensure that data is collected in a standard way so that it can easily be integrated and reused by others

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Continuously capture and monitor performance data to inform ongoing service improvements.

Measuring performance means continuously improving a service by:

- learning its strengths and weaknesses
- using data to support changes

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

**Digital Architectural Standards (GC):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
- {: .dpgn-digital-architectural-keep-data-organized-3} Custodians shall ensure data is correct, consistent, and complete.

**Ensure data is well-structured, intuitive and in a format that is easy to integrate and reuse by others (formerly guideline 10.6):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

- Ensure data is well-structured, intuitive and in a format that is easy to integrate and reuse by others
- Design data to have clear and simple semantics to make common tasks easy. Rare tasks should still be possible but not the focus. Avoid being overly general, optimizing specific use cases.
- Design data to be intuitive so that a semi-experienced user can be successful with minimal assistance from the documentation and programmers can easily integrate and reuse it.
- Design data with a consistent and precise naming convention. Use plain language and recognizable patterns and concepts, avoiding abbreviations where possible.

**Alpha, beta and live stages:**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
- determine data needs, sources and collection **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario / UK))**
- have an ongoing roadmap for performance analysis and someone in the team responsible for identifying actionable data insights during alpha, including assisted digital support **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- use qualitative and quantitative data to understand user needs and identify areas for change **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario / UK))**
- choose suitable data analysis tools **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- address information security and privacy issues appropriately **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- map user journeys through the service and track them to identify completions and areas of poor performance **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- document the next user story related to performance analysis **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- All services must, at a minimum, measure 4 KPIs. **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
  - User satisfaction - to help continually improve the user experience of your service
  - Digital take-up - to show how many people are using the service and to help encourage users to choose the digital service
  - Completion rate - to show which parts of the service you need to fix
  - Cost per transaction - to make your service more cost efficient
- There will be other metrics your service needs to measure and monitor to understand how it is performing, such as: **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
  - error rates
  - time to completion
  - costs, benefits and return on investment
  - content metrics (readability, length).

**Alpha stage:**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
- explored the data that is already available for an existing service, where it is kept and how you might access and use it, and also shared your own insights **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
- collected baseline data for the service operation in all of its channels **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
- estimated the number of people you expect to use the service **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
- started creating a performance framework outlining your objectives and what metrics your team will use to demonstrate you meet them **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
- considered the metrics you will need to measure the 4 KPIs and where the data will come from. **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
{: .dpgn-stage-alpha}

- which tools you use for analysis and web analytics in Beta (and Alpha if appropriate) **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
{: .dpgn-stage-beta}
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 -->

**Live stage:**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
- collect feedback from users, during and after their user journey **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- use web analytics to capture information about user behaviour online **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- monitor and evaluate user feedback and complaints from the digital service and other service touch-points such as phone and in person **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- analyze performance and identify actionable data insights as early as possible **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- define performance metrics for the service up-front, early on in the design process **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- {: .dpgn-stage-live} regularly review the technology used to provide the service and the processes that support the service **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- base your service review frequency on the volume of users ( e.g. 10,000 or less unique users per year = 2 year review cycle; 10,000-100,000 = annual; 100,000-1 million = every 6 months) **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- demonstrate how service performance compares to other similar government and private sector services **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- Your data should show: **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
  - user satisfaction has increased
  - digital take-up is increasing in line with service plans
  - completion rate has been maintained
  - cost per transaction is decreasing in line with service plans.
