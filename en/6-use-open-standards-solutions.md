## 6.1 Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Use open standards, open source software and common government platforms where available.

Open standards and open source software are published publicly, freely available for use by anyone, and are developed and maintained using a collaborative approach.

Using open standards and common government platforms will help the government:

- save time and money by reusing things that are already available
- move between different technologies when needed
- quickly and easily change a service when needed
- give people a more consistent experience of using government services online
- access a wider range of both open source and proprietary software vendors
- eliminate potentially restrictive long-term contracts

**(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

Build using open standards and common government platforms where appropriate.

Using open standards and common government platforms helps you to:

- meet the needs of your users by building with proven solutions
- make users’ experience of government more consistent, which generates trust
- save time and money by reusing things that are already available
- be more efficient by sharing data appropriately
- move between different technologies when you need to, avoiding vendor lock-in.

## 6.2 Use and reuse common, proven government solutions, approaches, and platforms

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector. **Digital Services Playbook (US))**

In order to limit costs, avoid duplication of effort and provide a consistent client experience when using various services, the reuse and adaptation of existing technological solutions is encouraged, where appropriate. If the development of new solutions is required, consider the ability of others to reuse and adapt your work as this will provide additional value on an organizational level. **(2. Reuse, improve and share technological solutions where appropriate (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**
- Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**
- Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**
- [Consider open source software solutions](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/memotociostechnologyneutrality.pdf) at every layer of the stack **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**
- Build standards-based solution **(Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
  - Adhere to GC technical standards and guidance, leveraging open standards when possible
  - Leverage common business capabilities and harness GC-wide solutions that can be reused across the enterprise
- Digital Exchange Platform (DXP) **(Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
  - Mandatory use of DXP (Canada’s XRoad) to foster seamless service delivery
- Pan-Canadian Trust Framework **(Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
  - Embed all services in Pan-Canadian Trust Framework to foster multi-jurisdictional service delivery
- Build toward OneGC **Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
  - OneGC is where Digital business changes are built to support a government as a platform where everyone can maximise shared capability (Platforms) and minimise unique department products
- Use departmental/GC standards. **(2. Reuse, improve and share technological solutions where appropriate (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Adopt the business number as the client identifier - do not create other unique identifiers. This enables data sharing across service lines, departments and jurisdictions.
  - Authenticated services must use only the federated credentials (e.g., SecureKey, GCKey). This enables a single login so clients do not need to re-authenticate their identity for each ISED service. It also ensures a sufficient level of security.
  - Build in client relationship management (e.g., MS Dynamics). This enables many capabilities such as the “Tell-me-once” feature, real-time status updates and omni-channel service delivery.
  - Utilize resources offered by the Chief Information Office (e.g., Master Data Management) to retrieve information that can help you have a holistic view of clients across the department.
  - Follow the [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/csc-grc-eng.asp)
  - For services that receive payments, adopt the departmental standard e-payment system. This provides a consistent client experience across ISED services.
  - Build in real-time status updates to your services, where appropriate.
- Use device-agnostic and modular technology. **(2. Reuse, improve and share technological solutions where appropriate (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Use technology that allows your service to function regardless of the device or operating system. Make sure mobile apps can function on all devices.
  - Modular technology can be reused, in part or in whole to innovate new solutions and uses for it. It also allows you to add new capabilities and capacities to your technology in response to changing operational environments.
- Choose solutions or parts thereof that are re-usable in another service context. **(2. Reuse, improve and share technological solutions where appropriate (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Use technology solutions that other business lines can reuse or adapt to their needs. This is both economical and practical as it permits future interoperability, and reduces the overall cost of follow-on digital transformation initiatives.
- Consider open source where feasible. **(2. Reuse, improve and share technological solutions where appropriate (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Open source refers to practices that allow other software developers to have access via a free license to another product’s programming code, thereby allowing others to make subsequent improvements or develop new products that work with the product (e.g., being able to incorporate Twitter into another service or product).
  - Open-source code is typically a collaborative effort where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community so that other members can help improve it further.
- Consider open data to the extent possible. **(2. Reuse, improve and share technological solutions where appropriate (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Open data is structured data that is machine-readable, is freely shared and can be used and/or built on without restrictions. It relies on three things: a permissive licensing model that encourages reuse, data discoverability and data accessibility. It also requires anonymization of data when involving potentially private information.
  - Open data increases transparency.
  - Open data leverages public sector information to develop consumer and commercial products.
  - Utilize the Government of Canada’s and ISED’s Application Programming Interface (API) Store.

## 6.3 Design for interoperability, allowing services to be discovered and leveraged by the community

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

Application Program Interfaces (APIs) are a means by which business functionality is exposed digitally. They are building blocks that are critical to the successful delivery of government online digital services and expanding service delivery to third party providers. They can also enable greater interoperability between services, optimized experiences across devices and can even lead to innovative new services by enabling third party products to work seamlessly with Government of Canada systems.

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Build services that are API-centric services, which execute most, if not all, functionality through API calls (e.g., connecting frontend to backend through an API)
- Plan out API access from the beginning, designing services to be able to safely and securely expose functionality to other systems and the public.
- Design APIs to be compete but also minimal, ensuring the expected functionality is provided but with as few public members per class and as few classes as possible. This makes it easier to understand, remember, debug and change the API.
- Design APIs to have clear and simple semantics to make common tasks easy. Rare tasks should still be possible but not the focus. Avoid being overly general, optimizing specific use cases.
- Design APIs to be intuitive so that a semi-experienced user can be successful with minimal assistance from the documentation and programmers can easily understand code that uses the API.
- Design APIs to be easy to memorize by implementing a consistent and precise naming convention. Use plain language and recognizable patterns and concepts, avoiding abbreviations where possible.
- API first **(Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
  - APIs created for every service, exposing data and functionality, to foster data sharing within GC and externally
  - Build microservices that work together within an ecosystem allowing for rapid deployment and built-in redundancy

## 6.5 Design, build and test end-to-end digital services

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

There are many potential benefits from the greater use of digital services, including greater convenience for users, quicker and more responsive service delivery, increased security and reliability and reduced costs. To maximize these potential benefits and avoid user reliance on less convenient ways of interacting with government, services should be designed to be digital from end-to-end.

## 6.6 Cloud first

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand. **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

Public cloud services offer benefits that enable significant advances in the following:

- Service performance: Self-service provisioning of computing resources can dramatically reduce the time to meet a requirement. Metrics-based service levels that are contractually enforced help ensure consistent performance levels.

- Security: Cloud-service providers hold internationally recognized security certifications that are assessed by third-party security professionals. These certifications include robust security features that would be a challenge for any one consumer to fund individually.
- Innovation: New features are being continuously deployed, and the costs are amortized across a global service customer base. New technologies such as social media, mobile platforms and analytic tools are all available through subscriptions without large capital investments.
- Agility: Rapid access is available to multi-featured computing resources at the required capacity to carry out projects from planning to full operation.
- Elasticity: Commoditized services can grow and shrink with the level of demand; consumers pay only for what is needed for the time it is needed.
- Cloud first **(Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
