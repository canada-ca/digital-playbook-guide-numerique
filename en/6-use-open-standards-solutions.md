**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Use open standards and common government platforms where available, including GOV.UK Verify as an option for identity assurance.

Using open standards and common government platforms means you:

- save time and money by reusing things that are already available, such as [GOV.UK Verify](https://govuk-verify.cloudapps.digital/) for identity assurance

- can move between different technologies when you need to and don't get locked into contracts which are difficult to end

- can quickly and easily change your service when you need to

- can give your users a more consistent experience when using government services online - this builds trust

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Use open standards, open source software and common government platforms where available.

Open standards and open source software are published publicly, freely available for use by anyone, and are developed and maintained using a collaborative approach.

### Why it matters

Using open standards and common government platforms will help the government:

- save time and money by reusing things that are already available

- move between different technologies when needed

- quickly and easily change a service when needed

- give people a more consistent experience of using government services online

- access a wider range of both open source and proprietary software vendors

- eliminate potentially restrictive long-term contracts

- [Choose a modern technology stack -- Digital Services Playbook (US)](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play8)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- [Consider open source software solutions](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/memotociostechnologyneutrality.pdf) at every layer of the stack **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

### Key Questions **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- What is your development stack and why did you choose it?

- Which databases are you using and why did you choose them?

- How long does it take for a new team member to start developing?

## 6.3 Design for interoperability, allowing services to be discovered and leveraged by the community

**Related (temporary for mapping purposes; remove later):**

- API enabled (OneGC product design criteria)

- Create API's in the developer's space (Build it Digital Principles (initial thoughts))

- Interoperability) (Current GC EARB Principles)

- Interoperability (- ESB/APIs -- Micro Services) (GC EA Principles)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**OneGC product design criteria:** Application Program Interfaces (APIs) are a means by which business functionality is exposed digitally. They are building blocks that are critical to the successful delivery of government online digital services and expanding service delivery to third party providers. They can also enable greater interoperability between services, optimized experiences across devices and can even lead to innovative new services by enabling third party products to work seamlessly with Government of Canada systems.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Build services that are API-centric services, which execute most, if not all, functionality through API calls (e.g., connecting frontend to backend through an API) **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Plan out API access from the beginning, designing services to be able to safely and securely expose functionality to other systems and the public. **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Design APIs to be compete but also minimal, ensuring the expected functionality is provided but with as few public members per class and as few classes as possible. This makes it easier to understand, remember, debug and change the API. **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Design APIs to have clear and simple semantics to make common tasks easy. Rare tasks should still be possible but not the focus. Avoid being overly general, optimizing specific use cases. **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Design APIs to be intuitive so that a semi-experienced user can be successful with minimal assistance from the documentation and programmers can easily understand code that uses the API. **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Design APIs to be easy to memorize by implementing a consistent and precise naming convention. Use plain language and recognizable patterns and concepts, avoiding abbreviations where possible. **(OneGC product design criteria)**

## 6.5 Design, build and test end-to-end digital services

**Related (temporary for mapping purposes; remove later):**

- OneGC product design criteria

- [Design the service from start to finish (Digital Service Standard (Ontario))](https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-service-standard#section-5)

- [Test the end-to-end service (Digital Service Standard (UK))](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/test-the-end-to-end-service)

- [Automate testing and deployments -- Digital Services Playbook (US)](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play10)

- DevOps (automated test and deployment tool) (GC EA Principles)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**OneGC product design criteria (End-to-end digital):** There are many potential benefits from the greater use of digital services, including greater convenience for users, quicker and more responsive service delivery, increased security and reliability and reduced costs. To maximize these potential benefits and avoid user reliance on less convenient ways of interacting with government, services should be designed to be digital from end-to-end.

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Design the service from start to finish):** Understand what users are trying to achieve and the steps required to complete that task. Every encounter should move the user closer towards their goal. Where possible, each step of the journey should be completed online.

### Why it matters

It's important to understand what users are trying to do when they access a service and how that service fits within the broader context of their life.

The service experience is much more than what people interact with on screen. It begins when they first hear about the service and it doesn't end until they've received the final product or confirmation.

Understand the complete end-to-end journey that users take to complete their objective, including the actions they take online, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter --- whether it's online or offline --- needs to be carefully considered and should help the user get closer to their end goal.

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Test the end-to-end service):** Be able to test the end-to-end service in an environment identical to that of the live version, including on all common browsers and devices, and using dummy accounts and a representative sample of users.

Testing the end-to-end service allows you to find problems and check that the service will work for the number of people who want to use it.

This means you're more likely to build something which works for your users.

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Test the end-to-end service):** Continuously test the end-to-end service to ensure that it remains available to users and free of errors.

Be sure to test with the browsers and devices that people will use to access the service, including assistive devices. An assistive device is a piece of equipment a person with a disability uses to help them with daily living (e.g., a screen reader or hearing aid).

### Why it matters

Don't wait until users discover an error in the online service. Monitor the service and avoid any downtime in the service. Users expect modern digital services to be online 24/7.

This means more satisfied users that have trust in government services.

**Digital Services Playbook (US) (Automating testing and deployments):** Today, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times a day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance are still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Be sure that you can clearly explain your service, what it does, and how you plan to move users to the digital service **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Design the digital service in a way that gives it clear advantages over other channels **(OneGC product design criteria)**

    - use data to understand other channels that the service is delivered through **(OneGC product design criteria)** / examine other channels to understand the steps users take to complete their goal and how your service fits **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

    - identify organizations and groups that help users with existing digital or non-digital services **(OneGC product design criteria)**

    - show a journey map of all the touch points in a user's experience of the service, from awareness of the service to completion and receipt of product (if applicable) **(OneGC product design criteria)** / show a journey map of all the touch points in a user's experience of the service, from awareness of the service to completion and receipt of product (if applicable) **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**



- Use familiar language and simple design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points, by ensuring consistent design across related digital services **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Take steps to ensure that the majority of users of your service are succeeding the first time they try to use it **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- demonstrate that there is a plan for error recovery at all steps in the service (i.e. if they get stuck during a digital service, what's the plan for a user when they phone for help?) **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- ensure prototypes incorporate the end-to-end user experience **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- show the results of research and usability testing and how these will be used to improve the design of the service **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- have a user research plan that spans every stage of service design up to launch of the live service, and includes next stages of service development **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- [Deploy in a flexible hosting environment -- Digital Services Playbook (US)](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play9)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**OneGC product design criteria:** Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand. Public cloud services offer benefits that enable significant advances in the following:

- Service performance: Self-service provisioning of computing resources can dramatically reduce the time to meet a requirement. Metrics-based service levels that are contractually enforced help ensure consistent performance levels.

- Security: Cloud-service providers hold internationally recognized security certifications that are assessed by third-party security professionals. These certifications include robust security features that would be a challenge for any one consumer to fund individually.

- Innovation: New features are being continuously deployed, and the costs are amortized across a global service customer base. New technologies such as social media, mobile platforms and analytic tools are all available through subscriptions without large capital investments.

- Agility: Rapid access is available to multi-featured computing resources at the required capacity to carry out projects from planning to full operation.

- Elasticity: Commoditized services can grow and shrink with the level of demand; consumers pay only for what is needed for the time it is needed.

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers that market themselves as "cloud hosting" but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.
