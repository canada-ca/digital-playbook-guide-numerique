**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**OneGC product design criteria:** Focus on the needs of your users, using agile, iterative and user-centred methods when building a service. Start with extensive research and analysis to help understand who is using the service, what their needs are and how the service will affect their lives to better understand how the service should be designed.

Users should be involved throughout the lifecycle of the service, with user research and testing informing the earliest design phases through to continuous improvements after the service has launched.

**Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED):** The absence of the client voice leads to assumptions that may be incorrect and costly. One way to challenge assumptions is to have quality qualitative and quantitative data. Data informed by client behaviours and needs will help you make the right decisions when designing and redesigning digital services. Service and digital performance and usage must be continuously measured in order to effectively direct transformation efforts. Client feedback should be collected and analyzed on an ongoing basis. Measurement and data analysis must remain integral to your service throughout its lifecycle. 

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Interview potential users to help develop the following for the service **(OneGC product design criteria)**:

    a.  User goals (e.g., As a \[user type\], I want \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\])

    b.  User personas (e.g., based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives)

    c.  User profiles (e.g., based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size)

- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviors **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Create and maintain a list of priority tasks that users are trying to accomplish (i.e., "user stories") **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Regularly test with users when building the service and after the service has been launched to ensure it meets the needs of user and to identify any parts of the service that users may find difficult **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Put in place a plan to pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it's built **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Use qualitative and quantitative data to help improve your understanding of user needs and identify areas for improvement **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Research what data is available **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Start with existing data before collecting new data. For example, use ISED data sources such as AWESOME and Client Enquiry Reporting Tool (CERT) to collect information on website usage and understanding ISED website, how clients interact with it, as well as their user experience.

- Define what data types should be collected and collect data in a consistent manner (e.g., client experience related to tasks or problems, client feedback and usability testing). **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Collecting data about your service allows you to measure its performance. You can use data to validate the following:
    - the service is meeting user needs
    - the service allows users to easily complete the task it provides
    - there are enough people using the service to make it cost-efficient
    - people know about the service and are choosing to use it

- Ensure data completeness and quality. **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Understand the limitations of data and use data appropriately.
  - To ensure the completeness and quality of data, consult with the Chief Information Officer (CIO), the Results and Delivery Unit and other internal data experts.

- Evaluate data quality by methods, such as certification or validation, or studies of the sources of error. **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Consult with the CIO and internal experts about data to develop or select a suitable methodology to validate and certify your data. 

- Continuously measure client experience and use this information to inform future service redesigns and service improvements **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Measure the service attributes (e.g., timeliness, completeness, usability, etc.) that matter to the client. Focus on customers' success metrics to drive priorities.
    - Use ISED's Service Management Strategy Key Performance Indicators (e.g., client satisfaction, increase in digital service uptake and service standards met) and the [Canada.ca](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/csc-grc-eng.asp) performance indicators.
    - Have a mechanism in place for clients to provide feedback and to address client service issues in a timely manner. This is a [requirement](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916b) under the Policy on Service

### Decision Making Questions: **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
#### Data
- What are the existing sources of data?
- Is there an opportunity to collect data and what tools can be used?
- Can the team analyze the data? Does the team need assistance?
- How will data be shared across ISED?
- Have the clients been profiled (including segmentation)?
- Have KPIs been identified, in addition to the mandatory KPIs (i.e. client satisfaction, increase in digital services uptake, service standards met)?

#### Acting on Feedback
- How will the feedback mechanism be implemented and delivered?
- What tools are available for collecting feedback?
- At what point during the process will feedback be collected?
- How will clients know that their feedback has been received and is being used to inform service improvements? How often will service improvements take place?

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people --- not constraints of government structures or silos --- should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Understand user needs. Research to develop a deep knowledge of who the service users are and what that means for the design of the service.

You need to understand the needs of your users so that you can build a service that:

- helps users do the thing they want to do at the first attempt without having to understand government

- is built on your users' real needs, not your assumptions

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Start with users to define the problem. Do research to develop a deep understanding of who the users are, how they behave and what that means for the design of the service.

### Why it matters

Understanding the people who use a service and what they want is critical to building a service that works for them. For example, users of a driver's license renewal service include any Ontarian with a driver's license.

It's easy to make assumptions about users or be influenced by personal experiences. When thinking about users, it's important to find people with different experiences and perspectives.

Get to know your users and their needs from their point of view -- beyond the lens of the project.

Taking the time to understand the people who use your service will help:

- deliver better solutions and service experiences

- discover additional opportunities and insights

- prevent wasted effort implementing the right idea in the wrong way

It's helpful to define average users and the not-so-average users (also known as atypical users). Atypical users include those who may be extremely satisfied or extremely dissatisfied with the service. Atypical users are a great source of insight because their needs are generally amplified versions of the more average users.

Use the needs of atypical users as a compass to help articulate the challenges that more digitally savvy users will struggle to voice. This is critical to building tools that work for everyone and avoiding inequalities through digital services.

To inform service features, interview users and gather data to develop:

- user goals - written in this format: As a \[user type\], I want
    \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\]

- user personas - show user groups based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives

- user profiles - show user groups based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size

**Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED):** A digital service must be designed in response to the needs of your clients. The team creating the service will require in-depth knowledge regarding the clients' experience. Dedicate a specific period of time (e.g., several weeks or a few months) to conduct client research to challenge assumptions that you may have about clients or the service. Throughout this Play, have empathy for the users of the service. Be open to new ways of thinking and be willing to collaborate with clients, service providers and colleagues across the Department, the Government of Canada, other levels of government and so forth as you address problems and identify solutions.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Share findings with the team and agency leadership **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people's needs **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Ensure user-centric approaches to service design, involving clients in the service design process where possible. **(General design principles - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Diagnose the problem **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Separate the problem from the symptom.
  - Do user research in order to identify the problem from the user/client perspective.
  - Experiment with different approaches for diagnosing the problem. Look for dependencies and interrelationships that may be contributing the problem

- Engage directly with clients and co-design services with your clients (where possible) **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Take time to identify and understand your clients. Collect and analyze data related to the client (i.e., if it is a business client, this could include size of a business, the frequency with which the client uses a service, preferred channels and other key information).
  - Develop client segments and use this information to gather additional insights and tailor services to client behaviours and needs. This information can also be useful for creating [User Personas](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Personas) that describe a client’s behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment. This helps make a realistic character that will guide decisions about how a service will be used and delivered.
  - Recruit a diverse group of clients (e.g., very familiar with your service, use the service infrequently, occasional users, etc.) for co-design sessions.
  - Observe clients/users as they use the service. This helps the service design to see things that the client may not tell you but are important.
  - Visualize/Map the service experience journey from the client’s perspective and the perspective of the various parts involved in how the service is delivered.
    - Use the [user journey map](http://uxmastery.com/how-to-create-a-customer-journey-map/) to see the entire client journey when using a service and to identify points of happiness and points of frustration with the service.
    - Use the [Service Blueprint](http://www.practicalservicedesign.com/the-guide) to have a holistic picture of all the parts involved in delivering the service. Service Blueprints provide a “behind-the-scenes” view of what is involved in shaping the client experience. Being aware of the underlying actors, systems, touchpoints, policies involved in service delivery is key step for improving government services.

- Understand and appreciate context **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Services are not websites. Websites are platforms for delivering a service. Design your service for people and the context in which they will use the service. Your goal should be to develop and deliver services that meet client needs.

- Be inclusive. Design services that are accessible for everyone **(Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**
  - Services for business need to be inclusive and accessible by everyone.
  - Accessible design is good design.
  - Make services that are simple and easy to use so that clients want to use it.

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Services Playbook (US) (Make it simple and intuitive):** We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter --- whether it's online or offline --- should move the user closer towards their goal.

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Be consistent):** When the public interacts with the Ontario government, their experience should feel cohesive, positive and consistent.

### Why it matters

Users should know when they are on an official government website.

Using standard platforms and designs is a cost-effective way of providing public services and makes the most of public resources.

Services delivered online, over the phone or in person should provide a consistent experience for the public. From branding to tone of voice and error handling, users should always feel confident in their ability to complete the service properly and our ability to guide them to the completion of their task.

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make sure users succeed the first time):** Create a service which is simple to use and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time.

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes user with disabilities or those who need assisted digital support.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help.

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Ensure users succeed the first time):** Using a government service should be an intuitive and stress-free experience. Good service should be so simple that users can succeed on their very first attempt without the need for any assistance.

### Why it matters

It's important to make sure service is as simple and straightforward as possible. All users, even those who have accessibility needs or lack digital experience, should be able to complete a service easily.

If a service is complex or unclear, users will be forced to contact that organization for help, use the phone or visit an office to complete their task. Or they may avoid using it altogether.

Not only does this lead to higher operational costs, but it also can lead to user frustration and a loss of confidence in government.

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make the user experience consistent with GOV.UK):** Build a service consistent with the user experience of the rest of GOV.UK including using the design patterns and style guide.

Using the same language and design patterns as the rest of GOV.UK means:

- users trust GOV.UK services because they recognise the style

- you don't have to build something entirely new so you save time and can focus on unique parts of your service

- you're using patterns and style which are based on data and user research.
