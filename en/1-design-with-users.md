## 1.1 Build nothing for the user, without the user being involved

Focus on the needs of your users, using agile, iterative and user-centred methods when building a service. Start with extensive research and analysis to help understand who is using the service, what their needs are and how the service will affect their lives to better understand how the service should be designed. The absence of the user voice leads to assumptions that may be incorrect and costly.

Users should be involved throughout the lifecycle of the service, with user research and testing informing the earliest design phases through to continuous improvements after the service has launched.

### Checklist

- Interview potential users to help develop the following for the service:

    a.  User goals (e.g., As a \[user type\], I want \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\])

    b.  User personas (e.g., based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives)

    c.  User profiles (e.g., based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size)

- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviors

- Create and maintain a list of priority tasks that users are trying to accomplish (i.e., "user stories")

- Regularly test with users when building the service and after the service has been launched to ensure it meets the needs of user and to identify any parts of the service that users may find difficult

- Put in place a plan to pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it's built

- Use qualitative and quantitative data to help improve your understanding of user needs and identify areas for improvement

- Provide a mechanism for users to provide feedback and to address service issues in a timely manner (as required by the [Policy on Service](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916b#cha7).

## 1.2 Empathize with the people using the service and have them engaged at all stages, from planning to ongoing improvements

User needs are constantly evolving which it is why it is important to plan for ongoing user research and usability testing. Engage users at all stages, continuously seeking feedback to ensure the service helps users to accomplish their tasks and to keep improving the service to better meet user needs.

## 1.3 Understand the context in which people are interacting and design appropriate solutions that meet their needs

A key part of building digital services that work for users is developing a good understanding of who are the users, what are their needs and how the service will affect their lives. It is equally important to develop a good understanding of the different contexts in which users could be interacting, since user needs and expectations can vary depending upon where, when and how they use a digital service.

## 1.6 Make services simple, intuitive and consistent

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Create a service which is simple to use and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time.

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes user with disabilities or those who need assisted digital support.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help. **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

## 1.7 Make it more convenient and practical to use digital services

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Encourage people to choose the digital service through every interaction they have with government.

Encouraging people to use digital service will:

- save money by reducing the number of people using non-digital channels, such as call centres

- help users to develop their digital skills

- give better support to those who can't use digital services on their own

**(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

### 1.8 Support people who cannot use digital services on their own

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Put tools in place across all channels to support people who cannot use digital services on their own.

Not everyone will have the same access, comfort and skill level to use digital service by default. Understand how and where users require support, make that support available, and raise awareness of that support. **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Support those who need it))**

Users may expect that an online service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

You need to have a plan for what to do if your service goes offline so that you know how users will be affected and how to get it back online. **(Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make a plan for being offline))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Leverage opportunities across multiple channels, implementing the relevant GC Policy requirements for each channel

- Do user research as early as possible to: **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
  - understand users' digital skill, confidence and access
  - find out why some users can't use the digital service independently, for example language or internet barriers
  - find out user needs for support

- Conduct research with users who: **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
  - already use the service or would use it
  - have the lowest level of digital skills, confidence and access
  - currently seek assisted digital support from others (like friends and family, colleagues, companies or charities)

- Determine how users would be affected if your service was unavailable for any length of time and how that's changed since beta **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Determine the most likely ways the service could go offline and how you plan to stop them **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Determine your strategy for dealing with outages, including who's responsible and the decisions they can make **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
