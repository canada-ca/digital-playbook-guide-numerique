## 1.1 Build nothing for the user, without the user being involved

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

Focus on the needs of your users, using agile, iterative and user-centred methods when building a service. Start with extensive research and analysis to help understand who is using the service, what their needs are and how the service will affect their lives to better understand how the service should be designed. The absence of the user voice leads to assumptions that may be incorrect and costly.

Users should be involved throughout the lifecycle of the service, with user research and testing informing the earliest design phases through to continuous improvements after the service has launched. **(GC)**

**Make services simple, intutive and consistent (formerly guideline 1.6):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

Create a service which is simple to use and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time.

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes user with disabilities or those who need assisted digital support.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help. **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

Using responsive design, following common design patterns and style guidance for digital content, and making sure the service is accessible means it will be simpler, clearer and faster for all users. It will also be available on the platforms and devices that users choose.

Consistent design that is responsive to different devices helps you to save time and money by re-using something that already exists that follows better practice, and is based on data and user research. This means you can concentrate on the unique things your service needs to do.

Responsive design ensures that users can interact with your service regardless of their device size or type, and browser or device processing power. The service should follow mobile-first design principles, consider users on slow internet connections or with limited download data, work well for both mouse and touch devices, and use front-end technology that works well regardless of device processing power.

Writing and designing content so it is consistent, plain and in the language of your users helps people gain trust and confidence in using different services. By providing information they can easily understand they may be less likely to use alternative websites that could be misleading. **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

- Interview potential users to help develop the following for the service:
  1. User goals (e.g., As a \[user type\], I want \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\])
  1. User personas (e.g., based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives)
  1. User profiles (e.g., based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size)
- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviors
- Create and maintain a list of priority tasks that users are trying to accomplish (i.e., "user stories")
- Regularly test with users when building the service and after the service has been launched to ensure it meets the needs of user and to identify any parts of the service that users may find difficult
- Put in place a plan to pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it's built
- Use qualitative and quantitative data to help improve your understanding of user needs and identify areas for improvement
- Provide a mechanism for users to provide feedback and to address service issues in a timely manner (as required by the [Policy on Service](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916#cha7)).
- use research, testing and analytics to improve the service **(7. Make it accessible, Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- explain all end-to-end user experiences, show they work and how they were tested **(7. Make it accessible, Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

**Make services simple, intutive and consistent (formerly guideline 1.6):**

## 1.2 Empathize with the people using the service and have them engaged at all stages, from planning to ongoing improvements

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

User needs are constantly evolving which it is why it is important to plan for ongoing user research and usability testing. Engage users at all stages, continuously seeking feedback to ensure the service helps users to accomplish their tasks and to keep improving the service to better meet user needs.

## 1.3 Understand the context in which people are interacting and design appropriate solutions that meet their needs

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

A key part of building digital services that work for users is developing a good understanding of who are the users, what are their needs and how the service will affect their lives. It is equally important to develop a good understanding of the different contexts in which users could be interacting, since user needs and expectations can vary depending upon where, when and how they use a digital service. **(GC)**

**Support people who cannot use digital services on their own (formerly guideline 1.8):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

Put tools in place across all channels to support people who cannot use digital services on their own.

Not everyone will have the same access, comfort and skill level to use digital service by default. Understand how and where users require support, make that support available, and raise awareness of that support. **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Support those who need it))**

Users may expect that an online service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

You need to have a plan for what to do if your service goes offline so that you know how users will be affected and how to get it back online. **(Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make a plan for being offline))**

Consider all the users in the service including end users, users in government who are delivering the service, and key intermediaries (professional and personal network) **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
- **What is the real task(s) that people are trying to achieve** when they encounter your service. What is the ‘job’ people are trying to get done that your service is a part of? (You need to describe this in words that real end users would use, not using government terminology) **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**
- **How are users currently doing the task** your service aims to help them do and key touch points, for example through journey maps.

## 1.4 Clearly articulate and understand the end-to-end problem and use data to demonstrate that it is being solved

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter --- whether it's online or offline --- should move the user closer towards their goal. **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

**Make it more convenient and practical to use digital services (formerly guideline 1.7):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

Encourage people to choose the digital service through every interaction they have with government.

Encouraging people to use digital service will:

- save money by reducing the number of people using non-digital channels, such as call centres
- help users to develop their digital skills
- give better support to those who can't use digital services on their own

**(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available channels if needed, without repetition or confusion.

People often start using a service and have to come back to it later, or switch to a non-digital channel to complete the transaction. We need to make sure users’ transitions between non-digital and digital channels, when they need to happen, are as smooth as possible. **(12.
