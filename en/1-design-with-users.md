## 1.1 Build nothing for the user, without the user being involved

Focus on the needs of your users, using agile, iterative and user-centred methods when building a service. Start with extensive research and analysis to help understand who is using the service, what their needs are and how the service will affect their lives to better understand how the service should be designed. The absence of the user voice leads to assumptions that may be incorrect and costly.

Users should be involved throughout the lifecycle of the service, with user research and testing informing the earliest design phases through to continuous improvements after the service has launched.

### Checklist

- Interview potential users to help develop the following for the service:

    a.  User goals (e.g., As a \[user type\], I want \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\])

    b.  User personas (e.g., based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives)

    c.  User profiles (e.g., based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size)

- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviors

- Create and maintain a list of priority tasks that users are trying to accomplish (i.e., "user stories")

- Regularly test with users when building the service and after the service has been launched to ensure it meets the needs of user and to identify any parts of the service that users may find difficult

- Put in place a plan to pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it's built

- Use qualitative and quantitative data to help improve your understanding of user needs and identify areas for improvement

- Provide a mechanism for users to provide feedback and to address service issues in a timely manner (as required by the [Policy on Service](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916#cha7).

## 1.2 Empathize with the people using the service and have them engaged at all stages, from planning to ongoing improvements

User needs are constantly evolving which it is why it is important to plan for ongoing user research and usability testing. Engage users at all stages, continuously seeking feedback to ensure the service helps users to accomplish their tasks and to keep improving the service to better meet user needs.

## 1.3 Understand the context in which people are interacting and design appropriate solutions that meet their needs

A key part of building digital services that work for users is developing a good understanding of who are the users, what are their needs and how the service will affect their lives. It is equally important to develop a good understanding of the different contexts in which users could be interacting, since user needs and expectations can vary depending upon where, when and how they use a digital service.

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Clearly defined user needs **(Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
  - User research, requirements and usability testing must be incorporated and tracked from the very beginning of any digital project

#### Alpha stage

- Spend time with current and prospective users of the service **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people's needs **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Identify parts of the service that users find difficult and any problems that need to be overcome to design the service **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- **Who are the users?** What about their motivations, triggers, contexts are significant for your service? How can you find them to invite them to participate in user research? You must include users with varying needs (such as needs arising from disability, cultural diversity, literacy and remoteness). Consider all the users in the service including end users, users in government who are delivering the service, and key intermediaries (professional and personal network) **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- **What is the real task(s) that people are trying to achieve** when they encounter your service. What is the ‘job’ people are trying to get done that your service is a part of? (You need to describe this in words that real end users would use, not using government terminology) **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- **How are users currently doing the task** your service aims to help them do and key touch points, for example through journey maps. What other relevant government and non-government services are also in use at this time? Where are the pain points in the current experience? **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- Document the design challenges your users' needs pose for your service **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Identify parts of the task which users find difficult and change the service to make these parts of the task easier for users, testing and researching to confirm this **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Document user stories, personas or profiles for your service - ie identify people who need to use the service and what they use it for, including users who need assisted digital support **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Document any problems that you found in research which you'll have to overcome to design the service **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Document how the design of the service has changed over time because of what you found in user research **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Greater depth and diversity of knowledge on all of the points above from Alpha **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

You can evidence this by showing how the design has changed over time and the appropriate research findings that have driven this change **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- **How you tested the system in the users’ context with a full range of users** (including users with varying needs). You can evidence this with artefacts of research, for example, video clips and outcomes from research analysis **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- **Are you prepared for ongoing user research?** Show how you plan to continue to test the system with users and the resources for this, for example through an ongoing research plan and budget **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- **What have you not solved yet?** What the significant design challenges are, for example through key insights, how have you approached them? How do you plan to continue to tackle them? **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- **How will you know if your design is working?** Make sure that research has fed into the metrics you have developed to know that you continue to meet your user needs **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

#### Live stage

- Use research and testing results to continuously improve the service **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- Identify parts of the task which users find difficult and change the service to make these parts of the task easier for users, testing and researching to confirm this **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Be able to show greater depth of knowledge for all the points above (from Alpha/Beta) **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- **Show how you are using data from real use** to understand which parts of the task users are finding difficult and how you are designing experiments to reduce friction and increase success for users **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

## 1.6 Make services simple, intuitive and consistent

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Create a service which is simple to use and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time.

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes user with disabilities or those who need assisted digital support.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help. **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

Using responsive design, following common design patterns and style guidance for digital content, and making sure the service is accessible means it will be simpler, clearer and faster for all users. It will also be available on the platforms and devices that users choose.

Consistent design that is responsive to different devices helps you to save time and money by re-using something that already exists that follows better practice, and is based on data and user research. This means you can concentrate on the unique things your service needs to do.

Responsive design ensures that users can interact with your service regardless of their device size or type, and browser or device processing power. The service should follow mobile-first design principles, consider users on slow internet connections or with limited download data, work well for both mouse and touch devices, and use front-end technology that works well regardless of device processing power.

Writing and designing content so it is consistent, plain and in the language of your users helps people gain trust and confidence in using different services. By providing information they can easily understand they may be less likely to use alternative websites that could be misleading. **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Test the name of the service and see if it makes sense to users **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Make sure most people can get through the service end-to-end without assistance **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Use analytics and user research to reduce the number of people who didn't complete the task they set out to do online (e.g. renew a driver's licence) **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- Use research, testing and analytics to make substantial iterations to your service, including the assisted digital support model **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Document all end-to-end user journeys, including assisted digital journeys, demonstrate that they work and how you tested them **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Make the service accessible, including for users with lower levels of digital skills **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- Make sure the service is responsive, with the same content and functionality on all devices, and works on mobile devices **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- Do usability testing:
  - including with users with the lowest level of digital skills **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
  - at least once before and after the service goes live and make improvements accordingly **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- Make design and content decisions based on research, testing and analytics **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

- change the interface design in response to usability testing, documenting the hypotheses you tested, what happened and how you reacted **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Make sure the service is responsive and works on mobile devices **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- understand how you will use responsive design for platform independence **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- understand how you will use existing design patterns and a front-end toolkit to make the service consistent **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- create simpler and clearer information by understanding the language of your users, using plain language by default, and applying contemporary online writing methods **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- follow accessibility better practice and are planning how your public prototype will meet WCAG 2.0 level AA **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

- ensure appropriate design, content design and front-end developer support is provided to the team. **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

## 1.7 Make it more convenient and practical to use digital services

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Encourage people to choose the digital service through every interaction they have with government.

Encouraging people to use digital service will:

- save money by reducing the number of people using non-digital channels, such as call centres

- help users to develop their digital skills

- give better support to those who can't use digital services on their own

**(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available channels if needed, without repetition or confusion.

People often start using a service and have to come back to it later, or switch to a non-digital channel to complete the transaction. We need to make sure users’ transitions between non-digital and digital channels, when they need to happen, are as smooth as possible.

**(12. Don’t forget the non-digital experience - Digital Service Standard (AU))**

Encourage users to choose the digital service and consolidate or phase out existing alternative channels where appropriate.

As we build simpler, clearer and faster government services the digital channel will become more convenient for users than non-digital channels like post, phone and shopfronts. Increased digital take-up will mean users can spend less time interacting with government. This will result in greater cost efficiencies for government.

Measuring digital take-up helps you to understand how well your service is being used. It’s one of the 4 mandatory KPIs services must report on the Performance Dashboard.

We still need to help users who are unable to use digital channels and provide support to those who need it. But we want to ensure digital channels are used whenever possible and to scale back, or phase out, alternative channels when we can.

**(13. Encourage everyone to use the digital service - Digital Service Standard (AU))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

## 1.8 Support people who cannot use digital services on their own

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Put tools in place across all channels to support people who cannot use digital services on their own.

Not everyone will have the same access, comfort and skill level to use digital service by default. Understand how and where users require support, make that support available, and raise awareness of that support. **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Support those who need it))**

Users may expect that an online service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

You need to have a plan for what to do if your service goes offline so that you know how users will be affected and how to get it back online. **(Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make a plan for being offline))**

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Leverage opportunities across multiple channels, implementing the relevant GC Policy requirements for each channel

- Do user research as early as possible to: **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
  - understand users' digital skill, confidence and access
  - find out why some users can't use the digital service independently, for example language or internet barriers
  - find out user needs for support

- Conduct research with users who: **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
  - already use the service or would use it
  - have the lowest level of digital skills, confidence and access
  - currently seek assisted digital support from others (like friends and family, colleagues, companies or charities)

- Determine how users would be affected if your service was unavailable for any length of time and how that's changed since beta **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
