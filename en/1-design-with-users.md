## 1.1 Build nothing for the user, without the user being involved

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

Focus on the needs of your users, using agile, iterative and user-centred methods when building a service. Start with extensive research and analysis to help understand who is using the service, what their needs are and how the service will affect their lives to better understand how the service should be designed. The absence of the user voice leads to assumptions that may be incorrect and costly.

Users should be involved throughout the lifecycle of the service, with user research and testing informing the earliest design phases through to continuous improvements after the service has launched.

### Checklist

**Alpha stage:**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
- Put in place a plan to pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it's built
- Interview potential users to help develop the following for the service:
  1. User goals (e.g., As a \[user type\], I want \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\])
  1. User personas (e.g., based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives)
  1. User profiles (e.g., based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size)
- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviours
{: .dpgn-stage-alpha}
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 -->

**Beta and live stages:**

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
- Regularly test with users when building the service and after the service has been launched to ensure it meets the needs of user and to identify any parts of the service that users may find difficult
- Provide a mechanism for users to provide feedback and to address service issues in a timely manner (as required by the [Policy on Service](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916#cha7)).

## 1.2 Empathize with the people using the service and have them engaged at all stages, from planning to ongoing improvements

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

User needs are constantly evolving which it is why it is important to plan for ongoing user research and usability testing. Engage users at all stages, continuously seeking feedback to ensure the service helps users to accomplish their tasks and to keep improving the service to better meet user needs.

## 1.3 Understand the context in which people are interacting and design appropriate solutions that meet their needs

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

A key part of building digital services that work for users is developing a good understanding of who are the users, what are their needs and how the service will affect their lives. It is equally important to develop a good understanding of the different contexts in which users could be interacting, since user needs and expectations can vary depending upon where, when and how they use a digital service.

## 1.4 Clearly articulate and understand the end-to-end problem and use data to demonstrate that it is being solved

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

When designing a service, it is important to determine the problems that the service needs to solve and how it will help users to achieve their goals. The focus shouldn't be just on the service itself, but also how the service fits in the overall user journey. The service should be designed to seamlessly integrate into the overall user journey and regularly measured to ensure that it is meeting user needs.

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

- {: .dpgn-stage-alpha} Create and maintain a list of priority tasks that users are trying to accomplish (i.e., "user stories")
- {: .dpgn-stage-alpha} Document all end-to-end user journeys, including journeys that involve multiple services and external services
- {: .dpgn-stage-beta .dpgn-stage-live} Regularly measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service and for the end-to-end experience
