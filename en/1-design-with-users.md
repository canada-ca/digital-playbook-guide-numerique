## 1.1 Build nothing for the user, without the user being involved

**Related (temporary for mapping purposes; remove later):**

- User tested (OneGC product design criteria)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**OneGC product design criteria:** Focus on the needs of your users, using agile, iterative and user-centred methods when building a service. Start with extensive research and analysis to help understand who is using the service, what their needs are and how the service will affect their lives to better understand how the service should be designed.

Users should be involved throughout the lifecycle of the service, with user research and testing informing the earliest design phases through to continuous improvements after the service has launched.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Interview potential users to help develop the following for the service **(OneGC product design criteria)**:

    a.  User goals (e.g., As a \[user type\], I want \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\])

    b.  User personas (e.g., based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives)

    c.  User profiles (e.g., based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size)

- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviors **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Create and maintain a list of priority tasks that users are trying to accomplish (i.e., "user stories") **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Regularly test with users when building the service and after the service has been launched to ensure it meets the needs of user and to identify any parts of the service that users may find difficult **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Put in place a plan to pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it's built **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Use qualitative and quantitative data to help improve your understanding of user needs and identify areas for improvement **(OneGC product design criteria)**

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Services Playbook (US):** We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people --- not constraints of government structures or silos --- should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Understand user needs. Research to develop a deep knowledge of who the service users are and what that means for the design of the service.

You need to understand the needs of your users so that you can build a service that:

- helps users do the thing they want to do at the first attempt without having to understand government

- is built on your users' real needs, not your assumptions

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Start with users to define the problem. Do research to develop a deep understanding of who the users are, how they behave and what that means for the design of the service.

### Why it matters

Understanding the people who use a service and what they want is critical to building a service that works for them. For example, users of a driver's license renewal service include any Ontarian with a driver's license.

It's easy to make assumptions about users or be influenced by personal experiences. When thinking about users, it's important to find people with different experiences and perspectives.

Get to know your users and their needs from their point of view -- beyond the lens of the project.

Taking the time to understand the people who use your service will help:

- deliver better solutions and service experiences

- discover additional opportunities and insights

- prevent wasted effort implementing the right idea in the wrong way

It's helpful to define average users and the not-so-average users (also known as atypical users). Atypical users include those who may be extremely satisfied or extremely dissatisfied with the service. Atypical users are a great source of insight because their needs are generally amplified versions of the more average users.

Use the needs of atypical users as a compass to help articulate the challenges that more digitally savvy users will struggle to voice. This is critical to building tools that work for everyone and avoiding inequalities through digital services.

To inform service features, interview users and gather data to develop:

- user goals - written in this format: As a \[user type\], I want
    \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\]

- user personas - show user groups based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives

- user profiles - show user groups based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Services Playbook (US) (Make it simple and intuitive):** We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter --- whether it's online or offline --- should move the user closer towards their goal.

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Be consistent):** When the public interacts with the Ontario government, their experience should feel cohesive, positive and consistent.

### Why it matters

Users should know when they are on an official government website.

Using standard platforms and designs is a cost-effective way of providing public services and makes the most of public resources.

Services delivered online, over the phone or in person should provide a consistent experience for the public. From branding to tone of voice and error handling, users should always feel confident in their ability to complete the service properly and our ability to guide them to the completion of their task.

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make sure users succeed the first time):** Create a service which is simple to use and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time.

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes user with disabilities or those who need assisted digital support.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help.

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Ensure users succeed the first time):** Using a government service should be an intuitive and stress-free experience. Good service should be so simple that users can succeed on their very first attempt without the need for any assistance.

### Why it matters

It's important to make sure service is as simple and straightforward as possible. All users, even those who have accessibility needs or lack digital experience, should be able to complete a service easily.

If a service is complex or unclear, users will be forced to contact that organization for help, use the phone or visit an office to complete their task. Or they may avoid using it altogether.

Not only does this lead to higher operational costs, but it also can lead to user frustration and a loss of confidence in government.

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make the user experience consistent with GOV.UK):** Build a service consistent with the user experience of the rest of GOV.UK including using the design patterns and style guide.

Using the same language and design patterns as the rest of GOV.UK means:

- users trust GOV.UK services because they recognise the style

- you don't have to build something entirely new so you save time and can focus on unique parts of your service

- you're using patterns and style which are based on data and user research.

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Encourage all users to use the digital service (with assisted digital support if required) alongside an appropriate plan to phase out non-digital channels and services.

Encouraging people to use your digital service allows you to:

- save money by reducing the number of people using non-digital channels, eg call centres

- help your users to develop their digital skills

- give better assisted digital support to those who can't use digital services on their own

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Encourage people to choose the digital service through every interaction they have with government.

#### Why it matters

Encouraging people to use digital service will:

- save money by reducing the number of people using non-digital channels, such as call centres

- help users to develop their digital skills

- give better support to those who can't use digital services on their own

- [Make a plan for being offline -- Digital Service Standard (UK)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/make-a-plan-for-being-offline)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Support those who need it):** Put tools in place across all channels to support people who cannot use digital services on their own.

### Why it matters

Not everyone will have the same access, comfort and skill level to use digital service by default. Understand how and where users require support, make that support available, and raise awareness of that support.

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make a plan for being offline):** Make a plan for the event of the digital service being taken temporarily offline.

Users may expect that an online service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

You need to have a plan for what to do if your service goes offline so that you know how users will be affected and how to get it back online.
