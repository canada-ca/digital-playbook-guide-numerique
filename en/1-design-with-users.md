## 1.1 Build nothing for the user, without the user being involved

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

Focus on the needs of your users, using agile, iterative and user-centred methods when building a service. Start with extensive research and analysis to help understand who is using the service, what their needs are and how the service will affect their lives to better understand how the service should be designed. The absence of the user voice leads to assumptions that may be incorrect and costly.

Users should be involved throughout the lifecycle of the service, with user research and testing informing the earliest design phases through to continuous improvements after the service has launched. **(GC)**

**Make services simple, intutive and consistent (formerly guideline 1.6):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

Create a service which is simple to use and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time.

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes user with disabilities or those who need assisted digital support.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help. **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

Using responsive design, following common design patterns and style guidance for digital content, and making sure the service is accessible means it will be simpler, clearer and faster for all users. It will also be available on the platforms and devices that users choose.

Consistent design that is responsive to different devices helps you to save time and money by re-using something that already exists that follows better practice, and is based on data and user research. This means you can concentrate on the unique things your service needs to do.

Responsive design ensures that users can interact with your service regardless of their device size or type, and browser or device processing power. The service should follow mobile-first design principles, consider users on slow internet connections or with limited download data, work well for both mouse and touch devices, and use front-end technology that works well regardless of device processing power.

Writing and designing content so it is consistent, plain and in the language of your users helps people gain trust and confidence in using different services. By providing information they can easily understand they may be less likely to use alternative websites that could be misleading. **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

- Interview potential users to help develop the following for the service:
  1. User goals (e.g., As a \[user type\], I want \[some goal\] so that \[some reason\])
  1. User personas (e.g., based on habits, personality, attitudes and motives)
  1. User profiles (e.g., based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family size)
- Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people's goals, needs, and behaviors
- Create and maintain a list of priority tasks that users are trying to accomplish (i.e., "user stories")
- Regularly test with users when building the service and after the service has been launched to ensure it meets the needs of user and to identify any parts of the service that users may find difficult
- Put in place a plan to pay for user research and usability tests throughout the design of the service and after it's built
- Use qualitative and quantitative data to help improve your understanding of user needs and identify areas for improvement
- Provide a mechanism for users to provide feedback and to address service issues in a timely manner (as required by the [Policy on Service](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916#cha7)).
- use research, testing and analytics to improve the service **(7. Make it accessible, Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- explain all end-to-end user experiences, show they work and how they were tested **(7. Make it accessible, Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

**Make services simple, intutive and consistent (formerly guideline 1.6):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

- Make services simple, intuitive and consistent
- Test the name of the service and see if it makes sense to users **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**
- Make sure most people can get through the service end-to-end without assistance **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- Use analytics and user research to reduce the number of people who didn't complete the task they set out to do online (e.g. renew a driver's licence) **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- Document all end-to-end user journeys, including assisted digital journeys, demonstrate that they work and how you tested them **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
- Make sure the service is responsive, with the same content and functionality on all devices, and works on mobile devices **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario / UK / AU))**
- Do usability testing:
  - including with users with the lowest level of digital skills **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**
  - at least once before and after the service goes live and make improvements accordingly **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**
- Make design and content decisions based on research, testing and analytics **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario / UK))**

## 1.3 Understand the context in which people are interacting and design appropriate solutions that meet their needs

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

A key part of building digital services that work for users is developing a good understanding of who are the users, what are their needs and how the service will affect their lives. It is equally important to develop a good understanding of the different contexts in which users could be interacting, since user needs and expectations can vary depending upon where, when and how they use a digital service. **(GC)**

**Support people who cannot use digital services on their own (formerly guideline 1.8):**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

Put tools in place across all channels to support people who cannot use digital services on their own.

Not everyone will have the same access, comfort and skill level to use digital service by default. Understand how and where users require support, make that support available, and raise awareness of that support. **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario) (Support those who need it))**

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter --- whether it's online or offline --- should move the user closer towards their goal. **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

**(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available channels if needed, without repetition or confusion.

People often start using a service and have to come back to it later, or switch to a non-digital channel to complete the transaction. We need to make sure users’ transitions between non-digital and digital channels, when they need to happen, are as smooth as possible. **(12.
