<div class="dpgn-section-intro-standard">

Building in accessibility from the start is key to ensuring that your programs, service, tools and applications can be used by everyone, including those living with a permanent disability, but also by those who may have a temporary limitation or disability due to illness, accident, environmental changes or technological difficulties.

Worldwide, over a billion people, about 15% of the world's population, have some form of disability. Between 110 million and 190 million adults have significant difficulties in functioning (<a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">World Health Organization</a>).

In Canada:

- 14% of the population (4.9 million Canadians) identify as a person with a disability
- 30% of the population have a disability if you include “invisible” disabilities (e.g., colour blindness, cognitive, mental health or chronic pain-related)
- 50% of the population have a disability if you take into account age-related impairments (e.g., low vision, low hearing or cognitive impairments)
- At least once in a person’s lifetime, they may also have a temporary disability brought on through accident, illness, repetitive strain or lifecycle changes (pregnancy).

## Curb Cut Effect

Curb cuts are intended to help wheelchairs get up on sidewalks, but they also help bicyclists, parents with strollers, delivery people, and many other non-disabled groups. This benefit to others became known as the “Curb-Cut Effect”.

When inclusive and accessible design is in place, it is a benefit for all and seamlessly meets the needs of individuals across the board, including people without disabilities.

<section>

## Situational Limitations

Sometimes people are in situations that limit their ability to hear, see, use their hands, concentrate, understand instructions, etc. Sometimes they are using devices that have limitations in size, input interface, etc. For example:

- Watching TV in a noisy environment (limits one's ability to hear, but closed captionning helps by conveying audio messages through text)
- Driving limits one's ability to concentrate on multiple things and limits the use of their hands. When drivers are lost, they often rely upon their smartphone for directions. To avoid getting tickets for distracting driving, taking one's eyes off the road or taking one's hands off the wheel, drivers can use voice recognition to ask the smartphone directions and have the directions read aloud.
- Walking around with small children (e.g., curb cuts for stollers, hands full, concentrate, understand instructions)
- Having one's hands full may require relying on smart speakers for instructions (e.g., getting recipe details while cooking, getting step-by-step instructions while fixing things around the home)
- Using a small mobile phone in bright sunlight, where the glare reduces visibility, while browsing the Web with only one hand (e.g., carrying a bag in the other hand) on a slow Internet connection
- Having to interact in another language

These limitations are sometimes mentioned as an example of how accessible design helps everyone, including people without disabilities.

## 2.1 Build for those with the greatest needs and it will work for everyone else

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that a high level of accessibility is applied uniformly across its service delivery channels. Technologies and standards are constantly evolving and accessibility plays a major role in making the Government of Canada more effective and inclusive. A more consistent, convenient, clear, and easy user experience when using government services online builds trust.

Development of accessible (regardless of ability, device or environment) digital services enhances the overall experience for everyone by improving and simplifying the overall design.

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Familiarize yourself with the standards
- Design the service to be as easy to use as possible. Usability is critical to making a service accessible for people with disabilities and limitations.
- Ensure design and development resources have the knowledge and expertise to build accessible services and to resolve accessibility issues.

## 2.2 Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards, and should not feel burdensome to use

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

Accessibility is not only required by law, it’s also good design. Creating fully accessible digital products and services improves the experience for everybody. Ensure the service is accessible to all users regardless of their individual abilities, device, environment or quality of access.

All users should be able to complete the service the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes users with disabilities or those who need help accessing digital tools. Assisted digital support means providing support to those who can’t use digital services on their own, and may include options to help people navigate an online service, such as offering assistance by phone and in person.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using the service or contact your organization to get help. **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

## 2.3 Co-create with people who have distinct needs, being inclusive from the very beginning

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Involving users early in projects helps you understand real-world accessibility issues, such as how people with disabilities and older people use the web with adaptive strategies and assistive technologies.

Involving users early helps you implement more effective accessibility solutions. It also broadens your perspective in a way that can lead you to discover new ways of thinking about your product that will make it work better for more people in more situations.

This applies when designing and developing:

- Websites and web applications
- Browsers, media players, and assistive technologies
- Authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog software, and WYSIWYG editors
- Accessibility standards and policies
- Web technologies and technical specifications, such as HTML

**([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))**

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

**[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Including Users to Understand the Issues ([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))
  - As early as possible in your project:
    - Learn the basics of how people with disabilities use the web by reading online resources and watching videos.
    - Find people with disabilities, with a range of characteristics. See Getting a Range of Users and Working with Users below.
    - Early on, learn about general issues related to what you are developing, e.g., websites, web tools, standards, or other products. Ask people to show you websites or related products that work well for them. Then, ask them to show you problems in products that do not work well. Ask lots of questions to help you understand the accessibility issues.
- Including Users in Implementation ([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))
  - For example, for websites, web applications, and web tools:
    - When you are considering a specific design aspect, such as expanding/collapsing navigation, find other products that are already doing it and have users explore with you what works well and what does not.
    - Throughout your design and development, ask users to review prototypes. Give them specific tasks to complete and see how the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved. Ask lots of questions.
- Carefully Consider Input ([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))
  - **Caution:** Carefully consider all input and **avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities**. A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with the web, nor know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. Getting input from a range of users is best.
- Getting a Range of Users ([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))
  - People with disabilities are as diverse as any people. They have diverse experiences, expectations, and preferences. They use diverse interaction techniques, adaptive strategies, and assistive technology configurations. People have different disabilities: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual — and some have multiple disabilities. Even within one category, there is extreme variation; for example, "visual disability" includes people who have been totally blind since birth, people who have distortion in their central vision from age-related degeneration, and people who temporarily have blurry vision from an injury or disease.
  - Include users with a variety of disabilities and user characteristics. Most projects have limited time and budget and cannot include many different users. Selecting the optimum number of users with the best suited characteristics can be difficult. There are resources on the web that provide guidance on selecting participants with disabilities; for example, determining participant characteristicslinks off WAI website and finding participants with disabilitieslinks off WAI website.
- Users' Experience Interacting with the Web ([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))
  - A primary consideration in selecting users is their experience interacting with the web. For example, some assistive technologies (AT) are complicated and difficult to learn. A user with insufficient experience may not know how to use the AT effectively. On the other hand, a very advanced user might know uncommon work-arounds to overcome problems in a website that the "average" user would not be able to handle.
  - In the early stages when you are first learning how people with disabilities interact with the web, it is usually best to get people with a fairly high experience level.
- Working with Users ([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))
  - Follow common practices for working with people informally and formally, for example:
  - Develop appropriate relationships with your users. For example, spending time talking informally over lunch may help you work together more comfortably.
  - Ensure informed consent and other research ethics. For example, participants in studies should be told that they are free to stop at any time.
  - Treat people with disabilities and older users with the respect you would any other users. For example, respect their time and provide appropriate compensation.
- Combine User Involvement with Standards ([Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving))
  - While including users with disabilities and older users with accessibility needs is key to making your accessibility efforts more effective and more efficient, that alone cannot address all issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. That is the role of accessibility standards.
  - For websites and web applications, using comprehensive standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 helps ensure that you address all issues. Combine user involvement with evaluating conformance to WCAG to ensure that accessibility is provided to users with a range of disabilities and situations.
  - For authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog software, and WYSIWYG editors, follow Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG).
  - For browsers, media players, and other 'user agents', follow User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG).

## 2.4 Take into consideration a user's possible constraints when designing services

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

People have different sensory, cognitive and physical abilities. All too often things are built for the fictional average person. Someone who has perfect vision and hearing, who uses a mouse or touch screen and has good basic literacy.

Very few people are like this, especially when you take into account that a person’s ability changes in different situations. For example, when using a mobile phone in bright daylight, the screen can become harder to see because of the reduced level of contrast. In a busy room, it can be difficult to hear because of the increased background noise. When some people are tired or stressed, information can be harder to understand.

Until you consider the needs of the range of people that will be using your service you can’t confirm that you are not excluding people. You also won’t be making the cost savings that digital services can provide as you will be forcing some people to use more expensive alternate channels.

**[Consider the range of people that will use your product or service (Government Digital Service blog (UK))](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/consider-the-range-of-people-that-will-use-your-product-or-service/)**
