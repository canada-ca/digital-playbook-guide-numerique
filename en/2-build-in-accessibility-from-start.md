**Introduction examples:**

The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that a high level of accessibility is applied uniformly across its service delivery channels. Technologies and standards are constantly evolving and accessibility plays a major role in making the Government of Canada more effective and inclusive. A more consistent, convenient, clear, and easy user experience when using government services online builds trust.

Development of accessible (regardless of ability, device or environment) digital services enhances the overall experience for everyone by improving and simplifying the overall design.

#### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Ensure design and development resources have the knowledge and expertise to build accessible services and to resolve accessibility issues.

- Ensure testing and quality assurance resources have the knowledge and expertise to identify accessibility issues.

- Ensure support resources are trained to assist persons with disabilities with completing tasks and accessing information.

- Design the service to work with a variety of browsers and devices, including assistive devices.

- Ensure testing processes include testing for conformance to WCAG 2.0 level AA and testing with a variety of browsers, devices and assistive devices.

- Make it easy for all users (including persons with disabilities) to provide feedback, address problems, and request support for using the service.

- Use ongoing research, testing and analytics to continually assess and improve the accessibility of the service.

### 2.2 Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards, and should not feel burdensome to use

- [Make it accessible -- Digital Service Standard (Ontario)](https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-service-standard#section-8)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Accessibility is not only required by law, it's also good design. Creating fully accessible digital products and services improves the experience for everybody. Ensure the service is accessible to all users regardless of their individual abilities, device or environment.

#### Why it matters

All users should be able to complete the service the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes users with disabilities or those who need help accessing digital tools. Assisted digital support means providing support to those who can't use digital services on their own, and may include options to help people navigate an online service, such as offering assistance by phone and in person.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using the service or contact your organization to get help.
