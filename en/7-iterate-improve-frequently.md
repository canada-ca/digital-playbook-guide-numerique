**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Build your service using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the manual.

Using agile methods helps you to build services that:

- meet the needs of your users

- are easy and convenient for people to use

- you can change easily, eg if government policy or technology policy changes

- you can keep improving, eg based on user feedback

- cost less and are more accountable

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Design and build the service using an agile and user-centred approach. Agile is an approach to building services that breaks the work into smaller chunks known as iterations. Build one feature of the service at a time until the entire service is complete.

It is a much lower risk approach than traditional build-it-all-at-once approach known as waterfall because frequent iterations expose any flaws in the original plan much faster (e.g. not getting approvals, not enough resources, not the right people on the team, etc.)

User-centred methods such as user research and usability testing put the focus on making services that are easy-to-use. Traditional government services focus on meeting business needs and aligning with policy goals. A user-centred approach ensures business needs are also balanced against user needs. This helps to increase digital service uptake.

### Why it matters

Agile methods build services that:

- can be prototyped quickly (and shown to users for regular feedback)

- meet the needs of users

- can change easily if, for example, government policy or technology changes

- can keep improving based on user feedback

- can be built quickly with a minimum set of features, and enhanced with more features after the service goes live

**Digital Service Playbook (US):** We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users' hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.

**3. Review and improve services continually (Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)):** The [TBS Policy on Service](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916) and the [TBS Management Accountability Framework (MAF)](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/maf-crg/index-eng.asp) require regular reviews of priority services in order to identify opportunities for service redesign." By reviewing services regularly, service providers can ensure that services continue to be relevant, effective and efficient, and deliver best value to clients.

Use quantitative and qualitative data to help with regular reviews of your service. User needs and technology evolve. There will always be room for improvement.

**3. Apply agile principles and be iterative. (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)):** Applying agile involves continuous improvement by analyzing data, making adjustments and iterating to identify and test improvements. Core principles of agile include defining a measurable goal; sharing ownership of the problem; taking small steps with visible impact; validating ideas/solutions with the target audience (e.g., the client); measuring success; reflecting, adjusting and iterating.

Start with a representation or prototype of the solution that will be tested and revised based on feedback and insights. Each iteration improves on the previous version. Your understanding of a problem and how to address it evolves each time you refine an idea and re-craft potential solutions. Taking an iterative approach also helps you reduce risks. It makes big failures less likely and turns mistakes into learning opportunities.

- Build and release a core-function oriented product that meets user needs. **(3. Apply agile principles and be iterative. (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Focus on developing a product that takes care of the client’s task(s). Additional capacities and new features to service can be added later as long as these add-ons do not result in the service/product losing effectiveness at core functions.
