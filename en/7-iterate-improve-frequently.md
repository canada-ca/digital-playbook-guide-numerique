**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Build your service using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the manual.

Using agile methods helps you to build services that:

- meet the needs of your users

- are easy and convenient for people to use

- you can change easily, eg if government policy or technology policy changes

- you can keep improving, eg based on user feedback

- cost less and are more accountable

**Digital Service Standard (Ontario):** Design and build the service using an agile and user-centred approach. Agile is an approach to building services that breaks the work into smaller chunks known as iterations. Build one feature of the service at a time until the entire service is complete.

It is a much lower risk approach than traditional build-it-all-at-once approach known as waterfall because frequent iterations expose any flaws in the original plan much faster (e.g. not getting approvals, not enough resources, not the right people on the team, etc.)

User-centred methods such as user research and usability testing put the focus on making services that are easy-to-use. Traditional government services focus on meeting business needs and aligning with policy goals. A user-centred approach ensures business needs are also balanced against user needs. This helps to increase digital service uptake.

### Why it matters

Agile methods build services that:

- can be prototyped quickly (and shown to users for regular feedback)

- meet the needs of users

- can change easily if, for example, government policy or technology changes

- can keep improving based on user feedback

- can be built quickly with a minimum set of features, and enhanced with more features after the service goes live

**Digital Service Playbook (US):** We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users' hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.

**3. Review and improve services continually (Think - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)):** The [TBS Policy on Service](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916) and the [TBS Management Accountability Framework (MAF)](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/maf-crg/index-eng.asp) require regular reviews of priority services in order to identify opportunities for service redesign." By reviewing services regularly, service providers can ensure that services continue to be relevant, effective and efficient, and deliver best value to clients.

Use quantitative and qualitative data to help with regular reviews of your service. User needs and technology evolve. There will always be room for improvement.

**3. Apply agile principles and be iterative. (Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)):** Applying agile involves continuous improvement by analyzing data, making adjustments and iterating to identify and test improvements. Core principles of agile include defining a measurable goal; sharing ownership of the problem; taking small steps with visible impact; validating ideas/solutions with the target audience (e.g., the client); measuring success; reflecting, adjusting and iterating.

Start with a representation or prototype of the solution that will be tested and revised based on feedback and insights. Each iteration improves on the previous version. Your understanding of a problem and how to address it evolves each time you refine an idea and re-craft potential solutions. Taking an iterative approach also helps you reduce risks. It makes big failures less likely and turns mistakes into learning opportunities.

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**2. Product management, not just project management. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)):** Once you have designed and launched a service, there is still work to do. Treat the service as a product; it requires regular reviews, usability tests and improvements. Unlike a project that has pre-determined start and end date, a product has a life cycle that goes far beyond the launching of the service. Regularly assessing the service and welcoming opportunities for improvement will help to ensure that the service keeps pace with evolving client needs and benefits from new or improved technology.

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK):** Build a service that can be iterated and improved on a frequent basis and make sure that you have the capacity, resources and technical flexibility to do so.

You need to build a service which you can iterate and keep improving so that you can:

- easily respond to changes in policy which affect the service

- make sure your service keeps meeting user needs

**1. Test the service before launching the service. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**: Services should be simple, inclusive and easy to use. Services should help clients achieve the outcomes that matter most. Assessing prototypes while the service is being designed will help you discover shortcomings that may deter clients from using the service or glitches that may affect the user experience. Assessing the service before it is officially launched will also help you make improvements that can go a long way in ensuring clients are satisfied when using the service. Rigorously and comprehensively testing the service from end-to-end is part of good service design.

### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Start small and build upon successes. **(General design principles - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

- Don’t wait for a fully developed service to start testing. **(1. Test the service before launching the service. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Develop a prototype of the service and test it to validate ideas, to challenge assumptions and to identify opportunities for improvement.

- Define your testing objective **(1. Test the service before launching the service. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Define the purpose of the test and what you want to learn? The purpose of the test is often determined by your business goals and user needs identified through feedback, analytics and other sources.
  - Identify top or critical tasks to test. Main outcomes and features your clients want to achieve should be prioritized.

- Test with clients and others **(1. Test the service before launching the service. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - You need to ensure that the service works from technical perspective and from the perspective of the user and the service provider (including the help desk agent who assists clients when they face challenges using the service). By testing with a diverse group and different type of users, you can capture a more comprehensive understanding of how your service is working.
  - Make sure the participants are representative of your clients.
  - Utilize user experience testing services offered by the Chief Information Office and the Communications team

- Plan and deliver client testing cycles **(1. Test the service before launching the service. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Pilot your test: Make sure it all works
  - Implement the test.
  - Test often (e.g., six month or yearly intervals), apply the findings and keep on testing.

- Test under realistic conditions **(1. Test the service before launching the service. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**  
  - Create realistic scenarios that reflect the context and environment in which clients would use the service.

- Use different types of tests to assess the service **(1. Test the service before launching the service. (Assess - Digital Design Playbook (ISED)))**
  - Identify the best testing method based on your needs. Examples of tests include:
    - Tree Testing - A test in which participants are asked to find a resource based on a series of menus.
    - Card Sorting Testing - A reverse tree test where participants sort through items and group them together in a hierarchal manner.
    - First Click Testing - A test that observes the first item that a participant clicks on and uses the selection as an indication as to whether users are directed as intended.
