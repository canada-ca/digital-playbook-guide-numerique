## 3.1 Empower multidisciplinary teams with diverse perspectives and skills

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

It’s important to have a strong multidisciplinary team in place, led by one person who is accountable and has the authority to make decisions based on the outcomes of research, testing and prototypes.

The team’s skills and focus need to evolve as the service is designed and developed. The team also needs to adapt its structure based on the needs of the service and the phase of work.

To be successful, build a team with:

- a broad mix of skills and roles from the start
- quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves
- the resources and ability to deliver the product
