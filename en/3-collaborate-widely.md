## 3.1 Empower multidisciplinary teams with diverse perspectives and skills

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and continuously improve the digital service, led by a skilled product manager who is empowered to make decisions.

The team's skills and focus need to evolve as the service is designed and developed. The team also needs to adapt its structure based on the needs of the service and the phase of work.

To be successful, build a team with:

- a broad mix of skills and roles from the start

- quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves

- the resources and ability to deliver the product

**(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

Establish a sustainable multidisciplinary team to design, build, operate and iterate the service, led by an experienced product manager with decision-making responsibility.

Good government services are built quickly and iteratively, based on user needs. Your digital delivery team must be set up in the right way to do this. They need:

- a broad mix of skills and roles from the start
- quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves
- to be adequately resourced and empowered to deliver the product or service.
