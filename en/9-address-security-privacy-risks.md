The digital revolution has fundamentally changed Canada’s social, economic, and cultural fabric. Canada’s participation in digital life has generated immense prosperity and benefits, and has opened a new gateway to the world. At the same time, it has continued to bring the world to us in new and challenging ways, and introduced threats that could undercut the many benefits of the digital age. Canada’s approach to cyber security must respond to this set of complex, integrated issues. 

> “Cyber security is the protection of digital information and the infrastructure on which it resides. Cyber security addresses the challenges and threats of cyberspace in order to secure the benefits and opportunities of digital life.” **Public Safety Canada, Cyber Security Strategy (2010-15)**

Canada’s National Cyber Security Strategy, first penned in 2010, has been developed with consideration to the evolving environment in which the GC functions, and formed around three pillars: 

1. **Security and Resilience:** prevention, mitigation, and response to advanced cyber-attacks targeting Canadian public and private systems and institutions, and increasing engagement on cyber security issues across all sectors.
2. **Cyber Innovation and Adaptability:** supporting initiatives that will allow the Canadian government to anticipate trends, adapt to a changing environment, and remain on the leading edge of innovation in cyber security.  Ensuring that Canada can build on the benefits that digital technology brings to both government, and society.
3. **Leadership and Collaboration:** working together to ensure the GC develops the skills, resources, and tools needed for effective cyber security leadership in Canada.

Effective cybersecurity is more than just defense: it is an essential enabler of digital transformation. Cyber and IT Security is on the front line with two critical imperatives:  Enable Business Growth; and Protect the Business.

Interconnected networks span a variety of ecosystems, from cloud and IoT to virtualized networks and endpoint devices; protecting what’s left of our borders is no longer enough. As digital systems’ connections are made on an increasing basis, previously clear boundaries coalesce into large interconnected networks, where vulnerabilities in up or downstream systems can ultimately impact your success. 

Undertaking a defense-in-depth approach provides layered security measures to help prevent against evolving and existing threats. Since the service boundary no longer exists at the perimeter, neither should the security boundary, as platforms create tighter and more complex interconnections. Developing trusted solutions and services, and keeping aware of changes to your operating environment will likewise provide positive results.  

Finally, “shifting security left” in your service design addresses security and privacy risks earlier in the process, and will go a long way to ensuring a long and successful life.

  ## 9.1 Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures

  <div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

  ### Increasing investment in digital services requires corresponding security improvements; new security concerns require new security solutions. ###

  We are moving further into the digital economy, where the bad actors are already there, waiting for us, and new security concerns require new security solutions.  As we take services to the cloud, implement and adopt IoT technologies, embrace a more mobile workforce, and interact with data and services that live outside your managed network (and often out of the sight or control of the IT organization), the potential attack surface grows.

  In order to be effective in risk management, business (risk) owners need to focus more on the consequence of inaction, and not on the cost of action. To do that, organizations need to understand what data is worth protecting, manage who and what can access it, and build effective defenses that both support innovation and protect the investment made in services and associated assets.

  Your level of investment in privacy and security is based on the perceived or actual value placed on the assets or information you are protecting. This valuation is often made taking into account the total cost of a breach, or the (more difficult) cost of a hit to one’s reputation.  When considering the balance of controls, include the cost of trust being reconsidered should your service be compromised. 

  Remember that security is not one-size fits all, and that your defenses are best developed to address the “soft spots” in your systems.  A defense-in-depth approach allows you to address security at multiple layers, hardening your systems as required, while providing unimpeded operations in others.

  ### Checklist

  - Determine what you absolutely need to protect – can you clearly identify what components are essential to the success of your service?  Not all assets need the same level of protection.
  - Determine what you’re willing to pay to protect it – can you protect your assets with the desired level of investment? Is the cost of protection 
  - Develop robust IT Continuity plans, including infrastructure and data backups, to ensure that your digital service is able to return to operational status with minimal disruption. **(Ransomware protection)**
  - Determine how long you need to protect your assets during and after their life / intended use.
  - Document the approach to security and risk management **(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

## 9.2 Innovate and improve while meeting the public's expectation that their data privacy will be protected

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

### Innovation must be matched by conscious responsibility regarding stewardship of users’ personal information and data. ###

> “… platforms have a responsibility to protect the privacy and personal data of citizens, and to protect the integrity of … system(s) where they operate." **Scott Brison, MP, Treasury Board of Canada President, 2018**

 > “Privacy and digital and service... are not easy things to juggle... and as the #gcdigital agenda evolves, we cannot lose sight of the fact this is an area we cannot fail in” **Alex Benay, GC CIO, 2018**

Both the value and the volume of data have never been higher, and end points (which are increasing in number faster than we can count) are more vulnerable than ever. If organizations and users can’t trust their data, and trust that it is safe, they will not engage or take the risks that drive growth. 

The problem with our increasing reliance on data is that anything that can be generated, transmitted, stored, or analyzed can also be stolen. This has never been clearer than it is now, as evidenced by the increasing number of major events across public and private organizations since 2013 (breaches at Yahoo, eBay, Target, and Equifax; responses to attacks against the GC, and Heartbleed, Java Struts, Spectre/Meltdown), whose cost has now reached billions of dollars. Fifty-five percent of Canadian small businesses [polled by Ipsos Reid in 2017](https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/half-of-canadian-executives-say-their-businesses-were-hacked-last-year-ipsos/87497) stated they either were hacked or suspect they may have been.

It is easy to assume that the primary threat exists from outside the organization, whereas the reality is that fraud, malicious and accidental insider threats, and ill-conceived data sharing mechanisms can be of equal threat to the integrity and security of user data. Organizations have a responsibility to ensure that the data under their care remains protected at all times, including in the process of sharing with external partners and within their own network.

### Checklist

<section class="dpgn-section-stage dpgn-phase-alpha"></section>

<section class="dpgn-section-stage dpgn-phase-live"></section>

- Identify and categorize the data the service will use, store or create. 
- Establish a data access audit process to provide assurance to users that their data has not been accessed in an unauthorized manner.
- Ensure every stakeholder of your digital system is prepared to commit to doing their part to secure mutually valuable assets
- Establish agreements with 3rd parties who may benefit from receiving data from your service in accordance with guidance such as the [TBS Guidance on Agreements Involving PII](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/privacy/guidance-preparing-information-sharing-agreements-involving-personal-information.html), to ensure they will treat your data with appropriate care.
- Ensure all APIs are developed in alignment with secure connections requirements from TBS and CSE; all APIs should be accessed over HTTPS only. **(Build It Right - OneGC Architectural Checklist (draft))**
- Ensure all APIs have appropriate authentication and that only authorized users/services are able to access the information; “open data” APIs are explicitly configured to allow access by all by default
- Ensure your digital service offers a quick and easy reporting mechanism, that enables the process of security vulnerability disclosures; alerts should be treated with care and consideration equal to internal evaluations.
- Develop your system with the 7 principles of [Privacy by Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design) in mind: 1) Proactive not reactive – preventative not remedial; 2) Privacy as the default setting; 3) Privacy embedded into design; 4) Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum; 5) End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection; 6) Visibility and transparency – keep it open; and 7) Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric. 
- Determine if bound by requirements imposed by the GDPR, and whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service
- Make sure the privacy policy stays up-to-date (Digital Service Standard (Ontario)) 
- Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept (Digital Services Playbook (US)) establish information management retention periods for your system
- Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach (Digital Services Playbook (US))

## 9.3 Make security seamless and frictionless, balancing security and convenience

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

### Seamless and frictionless security relies heavily on complex and advanced systems monitoring and securing user interactions and data interconnections. ###

In the digital economy, organizations must move to higher order technologies such as machine learning, AI, analytics, and the Internet of Things to retain their advantage. Each of these elements brings with them new threats and opportunities for compromise that erode users’ digital trust (based on the expectation of data privacy and effective data stewardship) developed with services.  

As digital services begin to rely on increasingly complex technologies for competitive advantage, so too must security teams. Advanced AI, analytics and machine learning are essential in effectively analyzing complex systems’ operations to provide security assurance to business owners. Seamless and frictionless security leverages advanced technology to provide the user the convenience they expect, while ensuring that systems’ processes and authorities are not compromised. 

More critically, digital security (and interoperability) is enabled by digital identity and the ability to effectively authenticate and authorize the user and their preferred devices. By leveraging combined information provided by the user to multiple sources, digital services are able to provide a rich and streamlined user experience. Bringing to bear emerging technologies to assist, organizations are turning to risk-based authentication and authorization mechanisms, using analytics to assess user behaviour and adapt security accordingly.

Advanced technologies including biometrics promise help to establish efficient and effective digital identification and access management systems. However service owners must be mindful that users will often find a way to circumvent burdensome security measures for convenience. It is important to design security measures that consider the user experience and help improve the overall posture to prevent workarounds.

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Checklist

- Implement identity and authorization mechanisms for all employees, partners and customer profiles, leveraging strategies that are proportional to the sensitivity of your service.
- "Shift security left,” ensuring that security is a consideration in requirements from the very beginning of service design through technical development, and is equally elegantly designed.
- Implement or onboard to an Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution that ensures users’ credentials are trusted and portable across devices of the user’s choice.
- Ensure your IAM solution is able to confirm users’ identities as early in (or prior to) establishing a trusted connection as possible.
- Where possible, provide users simple means of authentication (e.g.: biometrics) to your service.
- Provide users adequate information to ensure they fully understand the authority they are providing to 3rd party services.
- Maintain logs of user access to provide both users and business owners assurance that credentials are persistently secure.
- Implement layered defenses to reduce exposure to cyber threats with increased awareness and understanding to proactively manage such threats (OneGC product design criteria)
- Implement protective measures to enable the secure processing and sharing of data and information across government (OneGC product design criteria)

## 9.4 Ensure services comply with all legislated and regulatory requirements

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

### The law and governance in cyberspace is not the sole responsibility nor under the authority of any one specific government, or group; boundary-less services require a fulsome understanding of any jurisdiction in which you operate. ###

The law and governance in cyberspace is not the sole responsibility nor under the authority of any one specific government, or group. While local regulations have a direct impact on business operations, the community of peers joined in digital cyberspace are not bound by the same legal and regulatory requirements. Questions relating to who has the authority to make law, what are the applicable laws, and who has the power to enforce laws must at least be considered, if not answered.  

Efforts to develop international cybersecurity frameworks have been undertaken in the past, resulting in limited agreement to adopt domestic legislation, cooperate through mutual legal assistance in the event of a breach, and prosecute cybercrimes committed on its territory.  From the EU, both the directive on the security of Network and Infrastructure Systems (NIS directive), and the General Data Protection Regulation will have international impact, forcing nations who interact with the EU to make changes to data handling and protection mechanisms.  

In Canada, businesses and governments are both protected, and bound by laws and regulations stipulated in multiple acts protecting the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems and information.  Canada’s Criminal Code outlines laws covering the unauthorized use of computers (Sect 342.1 and 342.2), protecting services from both malicious misuse and data interception, but provides exceptions for consent (“express or implied”) or to protect the network. 

Canada has two significant privacy protections in place.  First, and most relevant to public digital services is the Privacy Act, which governs the personal information handling practices of the federal institutions. It limits the collection, use, sharing and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Similar to the GDPR, the [Privacy Act](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/for-federal-institutions/) gives individuals the right to access and request correction of personal information about themselves held by the federal government.  Federal privacy law for private-sector organizations is covered by the [Personal Information Protection & Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/). PIPEDA sets out the ground rules for how businesses must handle personal information in the course of commercial activity.

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

  ### Checklist

  - Engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the legal aspects of managing cyber risks
  - Document any outstanding legal concerns, such as data protection or data sharing (Digital Service Standard (Ontario))
  - Begin to identify and understand the jurisdictional requirements of where your digital service operates, and where your stakeholders are.
  - Identify the cybersecurity tools and services in use; learn how they work and handle data; and then analyze them against current law in each jurisdiction where your digital service uses them
  - Conduct a cyber law assessment to determine vulnerabilities, risks, and resources required to manage them
  - Develop, update, and maintain written cybersecurity policies and procedures, including on governance by both service and organizational management.
  - Develop and maintain cybersecurity training programs to develop appropriate behaviours and culture for employees and contractors
  - Ensure your service has properly documented event management processes, in the event of a data breach or compromise of the integrity of your systems.
  - Ensure your terms and conditions explicitly prohibit the conduct of offenses outlined in the criminal code, including hate speech, cybercrime, identity theft, etc.
  - Ensure your service is in alignment with Canadian data residency requirements per [ITPIN 2017-02 Direction for Electronic Data Residency](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/policy-implementation-notices/direction-electronic-data-residency.html).
