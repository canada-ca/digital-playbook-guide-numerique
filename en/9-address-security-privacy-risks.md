### 9.4 Ensure services comply with all legislated and regulatory requirements

- [Understand security and privacy issues -- Digital Service Standard (UK)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/understand-security-and-privacy-issues)

- [Manage security and privacy through reusable processes -- Digital Services Playbook (US)](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play11)

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Understand security and privacy issues):** Evaluate what user data and information the digital service will be providing or storing and address the security level, legal responsibilities, privacy issues and risks associated with the service (consulting with experts where appropriate).

Users won't use your service unless you can guarantee:

- it's confidential

- they can access their information in the service when they need to

**Digital Services Playbook (US) (Manage security and privacy through reusable processes):** Our digital services have to protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, how long it is kept, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.

The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.

#### Checklist

- **[TODO: Add/revise checklist items]**

- Implement layered defences to reduce exposure to cyber threats with increased awareness and understanding to proactively manage such threats **(OneGC product design criteria)**

- Implement protective measures to enable the secure processing and sharing of data and information across government **(OneGC product design criteria)**



- Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- "Pre-certify" the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**



- Alpha stage

    - identify threats to your service, including potential pathways for hackers, and tested ways of reducing them **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - keep up to date about threats to your service and how to deal with them **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - identify threats of fraud (fraud vectors) which exist and the controls to prototype to address them **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Beta stage

    - determine your team's approach to security and risk management **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - identify security and privacy threats to your service **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - identify the fraud vectors that exist and the controls you're putting in place to address them **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - work with the business and information risk teams eg senior information risk owner (SIRO), information asset owner (IAO) and data guardians, and work to meet any security regulations without putting delivery at risk **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - identify any outstanding legal concerns, eg how you'll protect data or your policy on sharing it **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - document your cookie and privacy policy and how you arrived at it **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- Live stage

    - determine your team's approach to security and risk management **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

    - make sure there are ongoing interactions with the business and information risk teams, eg SIRO, IAO and data guardians **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**



- identify any outstanding legal concerns, eg data protection or data sharing **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- keep your understanding of the threats to your service up to date, and explain how the threats have changed during beta **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

- keep your cookie policy and privacy policy up to date **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

#### Key Questions **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

- Does the service collect personal information from the user? How is the user notified of this collection?

- Does it collect more information than necessary? Could the data be used in ways an average user wouldn't expect?

- How does a user access, correct, delete, or remove personal information?

- Will any of the personal information stored in the system be shared with other services, people, or partners?

- How and how often is the service tested for security vulnerabilities?

- How can someone from the public report a security issue?
