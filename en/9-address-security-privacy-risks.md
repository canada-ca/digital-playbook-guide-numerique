## 9.4 Ensure services comply with all legislated and regulatory requirements

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**[TODO: Add/revise introductory text]**

**Introduction examples:**

**Digital Service Standard (UK) (Understand security and privacy issues):** Evaluate what user data and information the digital service will be providing or storing and address the security level, legal responsibilities, privacy issues and risks associated with the service (consulting with experts where appropriate).

Users won't use your service unless you can guarantee:

- it's confidential
- they can access their information in the service when they need to

**Digital Services Playbook (US) (Manage security and privacy through reusable processes):** Our digital services have to protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, how long it is kept, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.

The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.

**Digital Service Standard (AU) (Make it secure):**

Identify the data and information the service will use or create. Put appropriate legal, privacy and security measures in place.

People who use government services must have confidence that:

- any information they provide is confidential and stored appropriately
- the system they’re using is safe and secure
- they know how their information will be used by government
- they can easily retrieve information they provide.

If a service cannot guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system, people will not use it.
