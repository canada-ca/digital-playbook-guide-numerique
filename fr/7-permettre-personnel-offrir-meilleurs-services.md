## 7.1 Veiller à ce que les employés aient accès aux outils, à la formation et aux technologies dont ils ont besoin

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

We need to evaluate and determine the tools and systems that we will use to build and host the service, as well as prepare for the operation and measurement of the service. We will also need to determine how to procure or build these tools and systems efficiently.

We must seek out and use modern methods such as Agile to ensure that the digital services we own and implement are innovative. We must ensure that our teams are consistently engaged through various opportunities to learn and participate in knowledge-sharing, and that we are successfully collaborating with both internal and external partners.

## 7.2 Permettre aux équipes de prendre des décisions tout au long de la conception, de l’élaboration et de l’exploitation du service

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

We must empower staff to share power and control over projects. This can involve assigning tasks, setting priorities, troubleshooting problems, and assessing issues. As a whole, this will mean balancing a recognition of talent with a frank assessment of results.

We must always be searching for ways to improve service delivery, through review of business processes, user testing, and commitment to best practices for service delivery when designing or redesigning digital services. We need to maintain a strong working relationship with experienced contracting and budgeting officers to facilitate a smooth contracting process.

Every service must have a person that will hold the designate authority to make critical decisions (product owner). Key responsibilities will include managing how the project's vision is articulated, stakeholder/vendor relationships, efficiency, and accountability. This individual will also determine features of the service.
