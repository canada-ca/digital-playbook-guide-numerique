## 1.1 Ne rien construire pour l’utilisateur sans sa participation

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

Concentrez-vous sur les besoins de vos utilisateurs, en utilisant des méthodes agiles, itératives et centrées sur l'utilisateur lors de la construction d'un service. Commencez par une recherche et une analyse approfondies pour vous aider à comprendre qui utilise le service, quels sont ses besoins et comment le service affectera sa vie pour mieux comprendre comment le service devrait être conçu. L'absence de la voix de l'utilisateur conduit à des hypothèses qui peuvent être incorrectes et coûteuses.

Les utilisateurs doivent être impliqués tout au long du cycle de vie du service, les recherches et les tests des utilisateurs informant les premières phases de la conception jusqu'à des améliorations continues après le lancement du service.

</div>

<section class="dpgn-section-checklist">

### Liste de contrôle

- Interviewer les utilisateurs potentiels pour aider à développer les éléments suivants pour le service :
  a. Les objectifs de l'utilisateur (par exemple, en tant que \[type d'utilisateur\], je veux \[un certain mais\] de sorte que \[une raison quelconque\])
  b. Caractères de l'utilisateur (par exemple, en fonction des habitudes, de la personnalité, des attitudes et des motifs)
  c. Profils d'utilisateurs (Ex., En fonction de données démographiques telles que le sexe, l'âge, l'emplacement, le revenu et la taille de la famille)
- Utiliser une gamme de méthodes de recherche qualitative et quantitative pour déterminer les objectifs, les besoins et les comportements des personnes
- Créer et maintenir une liste des tâches prioritaires que les utilisateurs tentent de faire (c.-à-d., « User stories »)
- Tester régulièrement avec les utilisateurs lors de la construction du service et après le lancement du service pour vérifier qu'il répond aux besoins de l'utilisateur et pour identifier les parties du service que les utilisateurs peuvent trouver difficiles
- Mettre en place un plan de paiement pour la recherche de l'utilisateur et les tests d'utilisabilité tout au long de la conception du service et après sa construction
- Utiliser des données qualitatives et quantitatives pour vous aider à mieux comprendre les besoins des utilisateurs et identifier les points à améliorer
- Fournir un mécanisme aux utilisateurs permettant de recevoir une rétroaction et de régler en temps opportun les problèmes de services (comme l'exige la [Politique sur les services](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-fra.aspx?id=27916#cha7))

Les besoins des utilisateurs évoluent constamment, c'est pourquoi il est important de planifier la recherche continue des utilisateurs et les tests d'utilisabilité. Impliquer les utilisateurs à toutes les étapes, en recherchant continuellement des commentaires pour s'assurer que le service aide les utilisateurs à accomplir leurs tâches et continuer à améliorer le service pour mieux répondre aux besoins des utilisateurs.

## 1.3 Comprendre le contexte dans lequel les personnes interagissent et concevoir des solutions propres à répondre à leurs besoins

Un élément clé du développement de services numériques qui fonctionnent pour les utilisateurs consiste à bien comprendre qui sont les utilisateurs, quels sont leurs besoins et comment le service affectera leur vie. Il est également important de développer une bonne compréhension des différents contextes dans lesquels les utilisateurs peuvent interagir, car les besoins et les attentes des utilisateurs peuvent varier en fonction du lieu, du moment et de la manière dont ils utilisent un service numérique.

## 1.6 Rendre les services simples, intuitifs et cohérents

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**\[TODO: Ajouter / réviser le texte d'introduction\]**

Create a service which is simple to use and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time.

All users should be able to complete the task your service provides the first time they try, as quickly and easily as possible.

This includes user with disabilities or those who need assisted digital support.

If users find it difficult to complete the task the first time, they may avoid using your service or contact your organisation to get help. **(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

Using responsive design, following common design patterns and style guidance for digital content, and making sure the service is accessible means it will be simpler, clearer and faster for all users. It will also be available on the platforms and devices that users choose.

Consistent design that is responsive to different devices helps you to save time and money by re-using something that already exists that follows better practice, and is based on data and user research. This means you can concentrate on the unique things your service needs to do.

Responsive design ensures that users can interact with your service regardless of their device size or type, and browser or device processing power. The service should follow mobile-first design principles, consider users on slow internet connections or with limited download data, work well for both mouse and touch devices, and use front-end technology that works well regardless of device processing power.

Writing and designing content so it is consistent, plain and in the language of your users helps people gain trust and confidence in using different services. By providing information they can easily understand they may be less likely to use alternative websites that could be misleading. **(Digital Service Standard (AU))**

## 1.7 Rendre plus pratique et pratique l'utilisation des services numériques

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**\[TODO: Ajouter / réviser le texte d'introduction\]**

Encourage people to choose the digital service through every interaction they have with government.

Encouraging people to use digital service will:

- save money by reducing the number of people using non-digital channels, such as call centres
- help users to develop their digital skills
- give better support to those who can't use digital services on their own

**(Digital Service Standard (Ontario))**

Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available channels if needed, without repetition or confusion.

People often start using a service and have to come back to it later, or switch to a non-digital channel to complete the transaction. We need to make sure users’ transitions between non-digital and digital channels, when they need to happen, are as smooth as possible.

**(12. Don’t forget the non-digital experience - Digital Service Standard (AU))**

Encourage users to choose the digital service and consolidate or phase out existing alternative channels where appropriate.

As we build simpler, clearer and faster government services the digital channel will become more convenient for users than non-digital channels like post, phone and shopfronts. Increased digital take-up will mean users can spend less time interacting with government. This will result in greater cost efficiencies for government.

Measuring digital take-up helps you to understand how well your service is being used. It’s one of the 4 mandatory KPIs services must report on the Performance Dashboard.

We still need to help users who are unable to use digital channels and provide support to those who need it. But we want to ensure digital channels are used whenever possible and to scale back, or phase out, alternative channels when we can.

**(13. Encourage everyone to use the digital service - Digital Service Standard (AU))**

Put tools in place across all channels to support people who cannot use digital services on their own.

Users may expect that an online service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

You need to have a plan for what to do if your service goes offline so that you know how users will be affected and how to get it back online. **(Digital Service Standard (UK) (Make a plan for being offline))**
