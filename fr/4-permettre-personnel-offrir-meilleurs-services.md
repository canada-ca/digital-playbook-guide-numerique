## 4.2 Veiller à ce que le personnel ait accès aux outils et aux technologies dont il a besoin pour innover

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**\[TODO: Ajouter / réviser le texte d'introduction\]**

Evaluate what tools and systems will be used to build, host, operate and measure the service, and how to procure them.

Evaluating the tools and systems you use to build your service helps you to:

- check any risks or constraints associated with them
- avoid contracts that lock you in and stop you improving your service
- build a sustainable system which you can easily manage after your service goes live

**(Digital Service Standard (UK))**

The technology you choose to build your service must help you respond quickly and regularly to the needs and expectations of users. This criterion ensures you:

- consider all the risks and constraints associated with the technology you choose
- avoid contracts that lock you into particular solutions and limit your ability to make decisions to improve the service
- build a sustainable system that can be easily managed once live
- identify the required infrastructure to successfully and continuously deliver the digital service
- have a procurement approach that will not restrict, inhibit or limit ongoing and future service delivery
- consider existing tools and systems and avoid unnecessary fragmentation and/or costs
- consider appropriate tools and systems already in use in government
- embed measurement tools at the start of development.

## 4.3 Veiller à ce que l’équipe dispose des bons systèmes et processus pour créer

<div class="dpgn-section-intro-guideline">

**\[TODO: Ajouter / réviser le texte d'introduction\]**

To improve our chances of success when contracting out development work, we need to work with experienced budgeting and contracting officers. In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources. **(Digital Services Playbook (US))**

It is essential that business processes be reviewed to identify opportunities to improve service delivery. A website is not a service; it is just one channel for accessing or delivering a service. Designing new or redesigning existing digital services should also facilitate service delivery best practices (e.g., open data and joined-up services). **(Do - Digital Design Playbook (ISED))**

**Rendre une personne responsable du service (anciennement ligne directrice 4.5) :**
{: .dpgn-data-ignore}

Each service must have one person who has the authority and is responsibile for makingt business, product and technical decisions. This person is responsible for communicating the vision, making decisions in a timely fashion, managing stakeholder/vendor relationships, monitoring project health and is accountable for the success or failure of the service. This person also sets the strategy for the service, defines the features of the service, and is responsible for the service on an ongoing basis, until it is decommissioned. **(GC)**

**\[TODO: Ajouter / modifier les éléments de la liste de contrôle\]**

- S'assurer qu'une approche de gouvernance solide est en place
- Mettre l'accent sur l'innovation et la durabilité
- Share information:  Sharing information with employees is important because it not only helps to build trust; it gives employees important information that will allow them to make the best possible decisions in critical situations. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed (Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**
- Create clear goals and objectives:  Be clear with your vision, goals/objectives, and roles.  This will help create the framework necessary to guide employees to make empowered decisions to keep customers happy. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed (Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**
- Teach that it’s o.k. to make mistakes:  If you empower employees to make decisions that will help keep customers happy, then you have to be willing to allow them to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes.  Berating an employee who tried something new will only serve to keep others from trying new things. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed (Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**
- Create an environment that celebrates both successes and failures:  Don’t just celebrate the successes, celebrate the employees who took a risk but maybe didn’t obtain the results intended but learned valuable lessons themselves and for the company. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed (Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**
- Support a learning environment:  This is an ongoing process whereby teams look at various situations and discuss them together to determine how they might handle things differently in the future to achieve a different result.  This is really what our lives are all about...learning new things as we age, by analyzing the things we’ve done in the past. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed (Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**
- Let teams become the hierarchy:  This occurs by slowly and carefully transferring responsibilities from managers to teams.  This can be a very scary and difficult process that takes time, training and a lot of persistence (Kinicki & Kreitner, 2008, p. 335).  It’s been my personal experience that this requires a lot of support time to the teams as they move from depending on a manager to make decisions to being autonomous. **([6 Ways To Empower Others To Succeed (Lisa Quast, Forbes.com contributor)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2011/02/28/6-ways-to-empower-others-to-succeed/#3da10ac35c62))**
