## Introduction

</div>

The aim of the Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) is to develop a framework to help institutions better understand and mitigate the risks associated with Automated Decision Systems.

In developing the AIA, the following three key goals have been identified:

- Increase capacity to evaluate the impact of Automated Decision Systems including legal and ethical issues, such as disparate impacts and due process violations;
- Recommend the appropriate governance, oversight and/or design recommendations to institutions based on their existing or proposed automated decision systems; and
- Provide a mechanism for greater openness and transparency for public consultation and external review of the design and deployment of Automated Decision Systems in the public sector.
