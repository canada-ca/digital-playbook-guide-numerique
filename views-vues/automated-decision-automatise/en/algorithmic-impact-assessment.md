## Introduction

</div>

Governments are increasingly looking to utilize Automated Decision Systems to make, or assist in making administrative decisions. However, questions are being raised as to how to adequately assess the impacts that these systems may have on Canadians and federal institutions. The aim of the proposed Algorithmic Impact Assessment is to develop a framework to help institutions better understand and mitigate the risks associated with Automated Decision Systems and to provide the appropriate governance, oversight and reporting/audit requirements that best match the type of application being designed. The AIA supports the TBS Standard on Automated Decision-Making.

In developing this proposed AIA Framework, the following three key goals have been identified:

- Increase capacity to evaluate the impact of Automated Decision Systems including legal and ethical issues, such as disparate impacts and due process violations;
- Recommend the appropriate governance, oversight and/or design recommendations to institutions based on their existing or proposed automated decision systems; and
- Provide a mechanism for greater openness and transparency for public consultation and external review of the design and deployment of Automated Decision Systems in the public sector.
